          "text": "\n\nEugene M. Schwartz\n\nFOREWORD\nWelcome to the most sought aÓÇùer direct marketing masterpiece. ÓÅ¢is\nbook was recently selling for over $900 dollars used‚Äîso I decided to re-\nissue it. It is a real privilege to bring Gene Schwartz‚Äôs advertising wisdom\nback into print. We built a wonderful business based on his wisdom.\nHe was a special delight and a treat to know‚ÄîGene was 6‚Äô2‚Äù and\nreminded me of Gary Cooper in ÓÅ¢e Fountainhead. But Gene had much\nmore charm and wit and a fabulous, unforgettable smile.\nExciting sight‚Äîwatching the multi-talented genius‚Äôs \u0000ngers \u0000ying\nover the keyboard creating another brilliant ad. And then he‚Äôd sit back\nwith that great smile, read it over and enjoy it more and more.\nGene wrote advertising copy for the best direct marketers in America.\nAnd then he published a book in 1964 titled How to Double Your Child‚Äôs\nGrades in School, following up with How to Double Your Power to Learn\nand then Breakthrough Advertising in 1966.\nHe was very clever‚Äîhe exchanged his copywriting for access to\nmailing list names and promoted his own books to them! But then Gene\nhad a stroke in 1978 and he had trouble typing ‚Ä¶ for it affected his right\nside. But he worked and worked until he became quite pro\u0000cient typing\nwith just his leÓÇù hand.\nMy big idea‚ÄîRetain Gene as a business consultant instead of a\ncopywriter to guarantee him a regular income. He became very\nimportant to us in that new role. He helped very much in the creation of\nthe Bottom Line/Personal concept and of our editorial style. Awesome.\nÓÅ¢en there was Gene III, the scientist, always reading the leading-\nedge science books and belonging to a very sophisticated group that met\nweekly to discuss the implications of those scienti\u0000c advances on society.\nFinally, there was Gene IV‚Äîan amazing talent as an art collector,\ntogether with his wife Barbara, a famous interior designer. ÓÅ¢ey built a\nfabulous art collection betting on Hans Hoffman Morris Lewis, Frank\nStella, Donald Judd and Milton Avery well before anyone else had heard\nof them. ÓÅ¢eir \u0000rst acquisition was by the color-pioneer Hans Hoffman. It\n\ntook me years to appreciate Hoffman‚Äôs work. Barbara also helped me\nbuild an incredible collection of photographs that are now at the Art\nInstitute of Chicago. On my \u0000rst gallery tour with them‚ÄîI discovered a\ncrumpled photo by the Starn twins that had two words on it‚Äî\nConfusion/Order. ÓÅ¢at is what I‚Äôm devoted to‚Äîbringing order from\nconfusion. So Barbara and I built a very exciting Lessons in Life\ncollection. I was her \u0000rst art advisory client. And it is with her generous\npermission that we bring Gene‚Äôs classic book back into the world.\nMartin Edelston\nFounder and President. Boardroom Inc.\nPublisher of Bottom Line/Personal\nJanuary 2004\n\nPREFACE TO THE BOARDROOM EDITION\nÓÅ¢is book was \u0000rst published in 1966‚Äîwhat seems to be three\nlifetimes ago. It was put out by Prentice-Hall, a marvelous house: it sold\nonly a few thousand copies. But since it was published I have had people\ncoming to me regularly to tell me that they directly credit reading this\nbook with their making millions of dollars.\nÓÅ¢is is amazing enough, but even more remarkable is the fact that‚Äî\nwhen I look back on it‚Äînot a single one of these people was a copywriter.\nHere is a book that is called Breakthrough Advertising ‚Ä¶ and yet was used\nby men who were not in the business of advertising at all, to make more\nmoney than most of us ever dream of accumulating.\nHow did this happen? Why was a publisher, a \u0000nancier, a\nmanufacturer of novelties, able to make so very much money with a book\nthat is about putting sentences together? (ÓÅ¢e \u0000nancier told me that,\nwithin one year aÓÇùer obtaining the book, he had raised his net worth\nfrom $100,000 to $10 million). Are the sentences contained in the pages\nthat follow actually that powerful? Can they change the fortunes of men\nso radically? Are they far more universally adaptable than I had \u0000rst\nthought‚Ä¶ so they are no longer about advertising products, but literally\nabout opening whole new markets for them?\nÓÅ¢erefore, eighteen years later, when Boardroom Books asked me to\nrepublish this text. I had to study it again, with the fresh eyes of a person\nwho had not read it in all that time, to see what was the real content of\nmy book, and its real effect on its readers. I did. I discovered the secret.\nAnd I am using this introduction now to admit my red-faced shame.\nWhat I had thought I had written those many years ago was a book on\nadvertising; what I actually put down on these pages was an entirely\ndifferent book, on a far broader theme:\nÓÇªere is a way to develop an entirely new market for a new or an old\nproduct. ÓÇªat way involves a certain number of clearly de\u0000ned steps. And in\nthis book 1 show you every single one of those steps.\n\nAs you may know, all of us‚Äîno matter what official designation we\ngive the industry we do business in‚Äîare actually on a deeper level, in\nexactly the same profession. We are all simply creating or exploiting\nmarkets for our products. When the market is born, our business is\nsimultaneously given birth. When it grows so does our share of it. When\nit is mature, our sales charts develop their \u0000rst aches and pains. And at\nthat point, if we can develop a fresh new market for that old product, it is\nexactly as if we achieved the Faustian dream, and enabled that product to\ndrink from the proverbial ‚ÄúFountain of Youth.‚Äù\nWe are all primarily conceptual midwives, helping give birth to new\nmarkets for our products. All the other functions we or our business,\nperform‚Äîthe manufacturing, distribution, service, and all the rest‚Äîare\nsimply adjuncts to this vital central process.\nWe are, in a single phrase, ‚ÄúMarket-Makers.‚Äù We sense each new\nmarket in its turn. We test and evaluate its size and scope. We gauge its\ntrue potential \u0000nancial strength, and then we focus all the people, all the\nmoney and all the desire that makes it up on one ultimate object: our own\nproduct.\nMost of the time, the market exists before our product, and we simply\ntap its present strength. But, in this era of constant change, we ourselves\nmay help give it its \u0000rst viable \u0000nancial form. We may sense that people\nwant computers in their homes as well as their offices ‚Ä¶ or want to walk\naround all day with music plugged into their ears ‚Ä¶ or would like to\nspend three air-conditioned hours in a faraway galaxy, battling with light-\nswords against evil and tyranny.\nMaking a market, then, is not as I thought when I originally wrote\nthis book, simply a matter of making an ad. It is also the making of a\nproduct. And it is the making of a conduit through which that product\ncan be obtained by the people whom you have made desire it more than\nan equivalent sum of their money. ÓÅ¢is book outwardly talks about the\nsentences that make up the primary appeal of that product to that\nmarket. But its true and deeper message is found when it is interpreted as\na market-diviner, and a market-intensi\u0000er. In other words, its message\nwill show you how to \u0000nd your ‚Äúdream‚Äù market, and how to drive it into a\nnational ‚Äúfeeding frenzy.‚Äù\nAnd I have also made an equally important discovery upon reviewing\nthis book since it was \u0000rst published. ÓÅ¢e examples in its pages have\ngrown slightly older, but the principles that these examples manifest are\n\ntimeless. For example, if I were writing this book today, its examples\nwould show more appreciation of feminism, environmental awareness,\nhealth and \u0000tness striving‚Äîeven the blessed sexual revolution. ÓÅ¢ey\nwould be more open and more frank than they could have been then.\nAll this is for the good‚Äîbut this book is not about reviving today‚Äôs ads,\nbut creating from scratch tomorrow‚Äôs winners! ÓÅ¢is book is about avoiding\nthe need for copying or imitating another product or advertisement. So\ntoday‚Äôs examples are as ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù as those of two decades ago. ÓÅ¢is book\nis about what happens next, and the fundamental rules of making a\nfortune out of slightly redirecting that tomorrow.\nYou see, people don‚Äôt change: only the direction of their desires do.\nÓÅ¢ey cannot be made to want anything, nor is it necessary to create want.\nAll that is necessary is to be able to channel those wants into the proper\nproducts that offer legitimate satisfaction for them. It takes ‚Ä¶ ten million\n‚Ä¶ \u0000ÓÇùeen million ‚Ä¶ twenty-\u0000ve million ‚Ä¶ \u0000ÓÇùy million ‚Ä¶ one hundred\nand \u0000ÓÇùy million people ‚Ä¶ to create a vast market for your goods. But it\ntakes only one slip of paper‚Äîor‚Äî its recitation by a series of salesmen‚Äî\nto direct all those millions of people to your stores, or your catalogues, or\nyour wholesalers.\nNot one single thing has changed in that regard since I wrote this\nbook. Nor will it ever alter in the slightest.\nSo this book is not about building better mousetraps. It is, however,\nabout building larger mice, and then building terrifying fear of them in\nyour customers. In other words, it is about helping to shape the largest\nand strongest market possible, and then intensifying that market‚Äôs\nreaction to its basic need or problem, and to the ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù solution you\nhave to offer it.\nAsk Rodale Press‚Äîfor whom I sold over twenty million dollars of a\nsingle book, ÓÇªe Practical Encyclopedia of Natural Healing.\nAsk the publisher of this book. Boardroom Reports, Inc.‚Äîwho\nstarted out with $3,500 in total working capital, and who will probably do\nmore than 25 million dollars in gross volume next year, with I am proud\nto say at least a little bit of assistance from me.\nAsk the seventeen businesses I‚Äôve started or helped start‚Ä¶ (Twenty-\n\u0000ve percent of just one of them was sold for close to a million dollars in\none day.)\nÓÅ¢ese principles work. ÓÅ¢ey discover markets. ÓÅ¢ey build markets.\nÓÅ¢ey intensify markets. ÓÅ¢ey revitalize markets. ÓÅ¢ey perform, in sum,\n\nthe invaluable function of giving you customers for the products you want\nor have to sell.\nAnd that‚Äôs what we all need, isn‚Äôt it? Customers. ÓÅ¢is, therefore, is a\nbook full of customers‚Äîfor your products.\nIt is really nothing else. Just customers, by the millions. Eighteen\nyears have passed. ÓÅ¢ree lifetimes. ÓÅ¢ey‚Äôve been good years, and good\nlives. I hadn‚Äôt read the book since then, but some hidden part of me had\nremembered it, and I think it‚Äôs worth your reading now.\nIf you agree with me, why not write and tell me so. I have several\nmillionaires, and multi-millionaires, to my credit now. I‚Äôd like to make the\nnext one YOU.\nPlease help me.\nGene Schwartz\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCreativity Can Be Made to Order\nIf You Follow ÓÅ¢is Simple Rule\nIf you expect a scholarly tome on advertising, stop here.\nI am a mail order copy writer who makes his living by producing\nresults‚Äîin carefully-measured dollars of pro\u0000t‚Äîfrom the written word.\nMy income‚Äîmy standard of living‚Äîdepends bluntly and directly\nupon my ability to sell. And I have no salesmen to help me; no store-\nreputation to help me: no point-of-purchase reminders, no discounts,\nand no friendly sales clerks to give my products a push.\nI sell, or do not sell, on the basis of one tool alone‚Äîmy ad. ÓÅ¢erefore,\nI have done a great deal of thinking and experimenting with these ads.\nAnd, since I have had the good fortune to own my own mail order \u0000rms\nfor the last eleven years, I have had far greater freedom than most copy\nwriters to put my ideas to a conclusive test and to see whether or not they\nreally work. I believe, as do many other advertising men, that mail order\nis the greatest copy writing school in the world. In mail order for reasons\nwhich I‚Äôll reveal later in this book, YOU learn techniques and approaches\nto copy‚Äîespecially new-product and new-slant copy‚Äîthat you learn in\nno other branch of this business.\nSome of these techniques I have never seen discussed in any other\narticle or book on copy writing‚Äîand I think I‚Äôve read most of them. I\nhave explained these techniques in detail in the hope that they will prove\nas pro\u0000table to other copy writers as they‚Äôve been for me.\nCan they be used by non-mail-order copy writers as well? Most\nassuredly. J. K. Lasker once said that mail order makes a copy writer, but\nhis real payoff comes when he applies his mail order techniques to\ngeneral advertising. I think that B.B.D. & O., Ted Bates, Ogilvy, Young &\nRubicam and a dozen other agencies prove this every day.\nÓÅ¢erefore I‚Äôve written this book‚Äînot from the mail order perspective\nalone‚Äîbut from the universal problem of all copy writing: How to write a\n\nheadline‚Äîand an ad that follows it‚Äîthat will open up an entirely new\nmarket for its product. An ad that will give a new product immediate\npro\u0000t: that will give an old product a brand-new slant; that will give a\ncompetitively-battered product a new weapon‚Äînot only to protect itself\nagainst its imitators but to actually damage or destroy the loyalty of their\nfollowing.\nÓÅ¢ese objectives cannot be achieved by following somebody else‚Äôs\nformula‚Äîno matter how successful it was for them. ÓÅ¢ey demand\ncreativity. ÓÅ¢ey demand a brand-new headline; a brand-new approach to\nthe market: a literal advertising ‚Äúbreakthrough.‚Äù Hence the title of this\nbook.\nÓÅ¢is, then, is a practical book, of practical rules that produce, and\nexploit, creativity, and that are meant to pay off on the very \u0000rst ad. To\nput them to work, you start with these basic facts.\nBasic Facts of Life for Copy Writers\nWriting copy is like playing the stock market, or being an atomic\nphysicist.\nBasically all three of these professions‚Äîcopy writing, speculation and\nscience‚Äîare exactly alike. ÓÅ¢e same keys make each one of them work.\nAnd if you realize this, you can double the effectiveness of your copy\novernight.\nConsider these facts: All three of them deal with immense natural\nforces, gargantuan forces thousands of times more powerful than the men\nwho use them. In science, they are the fundamental energies of the\nuniverse. In speculation, they are the billion-dollar tides and currents of\nthe market place. In copy writing they are the hopes and fears and desires of\nmillions upon millions of men and women, all over the world.\nÓÅ¢e men who use these forces did not create them; they can neither\nturn them on nor shut them off, they can neither diminish them nor add\nto them. But they can harness them! ÓÅ¢e scientist did not create the\nenergy of the sun; hut he can direct that energy into the explosion of an\natom bomb. ÓÅ¢e speculator did not create the enormous growth of the\nelectronics industry aÓÇùer the war: but he can ride that growth to produce\na \u0000ÓÇùy times increase in his capital. And the copy writer does not create\nthe desire of millions of women all over America to lose weight; but he\n\ncan channel that desire onto a particular product, and make its owner a\nmillionaire.\nÓÅ¢is, then, is the end goal‚Äîto take these gigantic natural forces and\nharness them to our own uses. But how do we do it? No two of these\nforces are alike. Each is unique; each operates in a different way. ÓÅ¢e same\nformula, carefully worked out to release atomic energy, fails completely to\nsolve the problem of rocket propulsion. ÓÅ¢e same pattern of investment,\nthat spots the upturn in electronics and makes a fortune, loses that\nfortune in uranium. And the same advertising appeal, that builds an\nindustry in reducing, collapses completely when applied to health foods,\neven though both advertisements may reach exactly the same audience.\nWhy? Because no formula works twice. Each and every formula is\nsimply the written solution to a particular problem that occurred in the\npast. Change even one part of that problem, and you need an entirely\ndifferent formula.

ÓÅ¢e power, the force,\nthe overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from\nthe market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a\nproduct. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already\nexist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing\ndesires onto a particular product. ÓÅ¢is is the copy writer‚Äôs task: not to\ncreate this mass desire‚Äîbut to channel and direct it. Actually, it would be\nimpossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually\ncreate this mass desire. He can only exploit it. And he dies when he tries\nto run against it.\nÓÅ¢is has been shown time and time again in the automotive \u0000eld, for\nexample. In 1948, in order to display their rising standard of living, the\nAmerican public decided they wanted a longer, lower, wider car. Chrysler\nchose to buck the trend; and offered a \u0000ne, functional car‚Äîwith more\nhead, leg and shoulder room on the inside‚Äîbut shorter and squatter on\nthe outside. A multi-million dollar campaign was prepared by one of the\nmost creative agencies in America. But the results‚Äîagainst the tide of\nmass desire‚Äîwere catastrophic.\nIn 1954, cars had become universally long; and drivers were\nappraising each other‚Äôs car in terms of horsepower. Here was the rise to\ndominance of a vast new public demand. ÓÅ¢e Twin-H Hudson Hornet,\nthe twin-exhaust Cadillac, the Chrysler 300‚Äîall in turn exploited this\ntrend, and rode it to gain millions of dollars in extra sales. ÓÅ¢e Ford\nCompany decided to play it down, and devoted millions of advertising\ndollars to sell safety. Again, the advertising ran into a wall of disinterest:\nresults were non-existent; and the next year Ford produced, and\nadvertised, the highest-horsepower engines in their history.\nBut perhaps the most painful proof was the Edsel. Here was a good\ncar, backed by a deluge of \u0000ne advertising, which died trying to \u0000ght the\noverwhelming switch in demand to a cheap, simple, inexpensive-to-run\ncompact car.\nLet me repeat. ÓÅ¢is mass desire must already be there. It must already\nexist. You cannot create it, and you cannot \u0000ght it. But you can‚Äîand must\n‚Äîdirect it, channel it, focus it onto your particular product.\n\nWhat Is ÓÅ¢is Mass Desire‚Äîand How Is It\nCreated?\nWe can de\u0000ne this Mass Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a\nprivate want.\nAdvertising is a business of statistics. We deal with percentages of\npopulation. We address our ads to individuals; and yet the success of our\nadvertising depends on thousands, or even millions, of these individuals\nsharing the same response to these ads‚Äîthe response of wanting our\nproduct enough to pay us the price we ask for it.\nBefore these individuals can share this buying response, they must\n\u0000rst share the desire upon which our ad is based. Privately, each of them\nwants the same thing. Publicly there are enough of them to repay us the\ncost of advertising, manufacturing and selling, plus a pro\u0000t. It is the\nmoment when a private desire is shared by a statistically signi\u0000cant number\nof people, large enough to pro\u0000tably repay selling these people, that a\nmarket is born. ÓÅ¢is market may consist of a desire shared by only a few\nthousand people, such as the urge to own \u0000ne antiques. Or it may be\nshared by tens of millions, as the desire to lose weight. But it is there,\ndemanding to be satis\u0000ed, waiting only for the information that will\ndirect it onto a particular product.\nSince these mass desires are shared by millions of people, they take\nyears to develop, and they are created by social, economic and\ntechnological forces far greater than advertising itself can command. It is\nthis fact, when used correctly that gives advertising its enormous\npotential for pro\u0000t. By simply directing this gigantic, already-existing\nmass desire‚Äîrather than being required to create it‚Äîadvertising thus\ncommands an economic force hundreds of times more powerful than the\nmere number of dollars that the advertiser can spend on it. ÓÅ¢is is the\nAmpli\u0000cation Effect of successful advertising‚Äîthe reason that $1 spent on\nsuch advertising can create $50 or even $100 in sales.\nBut this Ampli\u0000cation Effect takes place only when advertising\nexploits already-existing desire. When it tries to create this desire, it is no\nlonger advertising but education. And, as education, it can produce at\nbest only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on advertising. No\nsingle advertiser can afford to educate the American public. He must rely\non forces far greater than any advertising budget to build this mass desire.\nAnd then he can make those forces work for him‚Äîby directing that\ndesire onto his particular product.\n\nWhat are these nationwide forces that create this mass desire? ÓÅ¢ere\nare many of them. But they fall into two general categories‚Äîeach\npresenting its distinct problem to the copy writer. Here are these two\ncategories, with a few speci\u0000c examples of each.\n1. Permanent Forces\nMass Instinct. ÓÅ¢e desire of women to be attractive, or men to be\nvirile, or men and women both to keep their health. In this case, the\ninstinct never fades‚Äîthe desire never changes. ÓÅ¢e copy writer‚Äôs problem\nhere is not to pick out the trend‚Äîit is there for everyone to see. His job is\nto distinguish his product from the others that were there before it‚Äîto\ncreate a fresh appeal‚Äîto build a stronger believability‚Äîto shiÓÇù desire\nfrom the ful\u0000llment offered by one product to that offered by another.\nHow this is done, we shall see in a moment.\nA mass technological problem. Bad television reception, or corroding\nautomobile mufflers, or the time it takes for aspirin to bring relief. Until\nthe problem is \u0000nally solved, the customers will buy and try‚Äîbuy and try\nagain. And here the copy writer has the same problem‚Äîto offer the same\nclaim of relief as his competitors, but offer it in a new way.\n2. ÓÅ¢e Forces of Change\nÓÇªe beginning, the ful\u0000llment, and the reversal of a trend. Style. ÓÅ¢e\nsudden mass decision to show off a pay raise by installing a swimming\npool in the back yard, instead of buying a bigger car. ÓÅ¢e horsepower\nappeal of the FiÓÇùies, and its sudden subordination to gas economy. Here\nthe copy writer is dealing with the straws in the wind that may indicate a\nhurricane. Here he needs sensitivity, foresight, intuition. He must be able\nto see and catch the rising tide when it‚Äôs almost imperceptible‚Äîsense\nwhich of the several appeals that are built into his product he should\nstress at any particular moment, and when to shiÓÇù to another‚Äîand,\nalways, how to be there \u0000rst.\nMass Education. ÓÅ¢e school primer and the movie screen. ÓÅ¢e tastes\nand appearances of society women, television stars, presidential\ncandidates, trickling down to every hamlet in America. Group pressure;\nbackyard gossip; community product pioneers. And equally important,\nthe sum total of all advertising‚Äîin its unconscious, unplanned and\n\noverall effect of multiplying people‚Äôs dreams and desires, and thus raising\ntheir standard of living. Here again the problem is timing. When does the\nshiÓÇù become statistically signi\u0000cant? When do enough people make the\nchange? When should the automotive powerhouse, for example, change\nits image to become the common man‚Äôs gas saver? ÓÅ¢e copy writer is\nfaced with a society containing dozens‚Äîeven hundreds‚Äîof these\nalready-existing mass desires. His \u0000rst job therefore is to detect them‚Äî\ninventory them‚Äîchart their force and direction. ÓÅ¢is is a study that will\noccupy part of every working day for the rest of his life.\nHis second job is to harness his products onto their backs. He does\nthis in this way:\nHow to Channel Mass Desire Onto Your\nParticular Product\nÓÅ¢e copy writer in his work uses three tools: his own knowledge of\npeople‚Äôs hopes, dreams, desires and emotions; his client‚Äôs product; and the\nadvertising message, which connects the two.\nÓÅ¢e copy writer performs his work in three stages. In general, they go\nsomething like this:\n1. Choose the most powerful desire that can possibly he applied to your\nproduct.\nEvery mass desire has three vital dimensions. ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is urgency,\nintensity, degree of demand to be satis\u0000ed. For example, constant\narthritic pains compared to a minor headache. ÓÅ¢e second dimension is\nstaying power, degree of repetition, the inability to become satiated. For\nexample, raw hunger compared to a craving for gourmet foods. And the\nthird dimension is scope‚Äîthe number of people who share this desire.\nFor example, the number of men willing to pay $10 for an automotive\naccessory that saves gas‚Äîas compared to those willing to pay the same\nprice for one that merely prevents future repair bills.\nEvery product appeals to two, three or four of these mass desires. But\nonly one can predominate; only one can reach out through your headline\nto your customer. Only one is the key that unlocks the maximum\neconomic power at the particular time your advertisement is published.\nYour choice among these alternate desires is the most important step you\nwill take in writing your ad. If it is wrong, nothing else that you do in the\n\nad will matter. ÓÅ¢is choice is embodied in your headline. It is for this\nreason that we spend so many chapters on headlines later on.\nTo sum up the \u0000rst stage then, you try to choose the mass desire that\ngives you the most power in all three dimensions. You try to tap a single\noverwhelming desire existing today in the hearts and minds of millions of\npeople who are actively seeking to satisfy it at this very moment.\n2. Acknowledge that desire‚Äîreinforce it‚Äîand/or offer the means to\nsatisfy it‚Äîin a single statement in the headline of your ad.\nÓÅ¢is headline is the bridge between your prospect and your product.\nIt touches your prospect at the point of awareness that he has arrived at\ntoday.\nIf he is aware of your product, and realizes that it can satisfy\nhis desire, your headline starts with your product.\nIf he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire\nitself, your headline starts with the desire.\nAnd, if he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is\nconcerned only with a general problem, your headline starts\nwith that problem and crystalizes it into a speci\u0000c need.\nIn any case, your headline‚Äîthough it may never mention your\nproduct‚Äîis the \u0000rst vital step in recognizing this mass desire‚Äîjustifying\nand intensifying it‚Äîand directing its solution along one speci\u0000c path.\n3. And then you take the series of performances that are built into your\nproduct‚Äîwhat your product does‚Äîand you show your prospect how these\nproduct performances inevitably satisfy that desire.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nÓÅ¢e Analysis of Your Product: What It Is‚Äîand\nWhat It Does\nIn reality, every product you are given to sell is actually two products.\nOne of them is the physical product‚Äîthe steel, glass, paper or tobacco\nthat the manufacturer has shaped into a particular pattern, of which he is\njustly proud. ÓÅ¢e other is the functional product‚Äîthe product in action‚Äî\nthe series of bene\u0000ts that your product performs for your consumer, and\non the basis of which he buys your product.\nÓÅ¢e physical product does not sell. People do not buy the steel in a\ncar, the glass in a vase, the tobacco in a cigarette, or the paper in a book.\n\nÓÅ¢e physical part of your product is of value only because it enables\nyour product to do things for people. ÓÅ¢e important part of your product\nis what it does. ÓÅ¢e rest‚Äîthe steel skeleton‚Äîthe chrome or metal case\nthat you actually deliver to your customer‚Äîis only your excuse for\ncharging them your price. What they are really paying you for is what the\nproduct will do.\nNo physical part of your product can ever become a headline. No one\nwill buy the size of your client‚Äôs plant, the weight of your client‚Äôs steel, the\ncare of your client‚Äôs construction. All these facts can only be used, later\non, to document and reinforce the primary performance that you\npromise your reader in your headline, in the following ways:\nBy justifying your price. ÓÅ¢is is the common-sense theory that the\nlonger the car, the more tubes in the television set, the more stitches per\ninch in the suit, then the greater the number of dollars your product can\ncommand‚Äîif that product \u0000rst delivers the performance that your\nprospect demands.\nBy documenting the quality of your performance. Tell your prospect\nthe weight of steel in your car‚Äôs door, and he‚Äôs more likely to believe that\nyour car will protect his life if he should have an accident on the highway.\nTell your prospect the number of times your plant removes the impurities\nin your face cream, and she‚Äôs more likely to believe that your cream will\nremove the impurities in her skin.\nBy assuring your prospect that that performance will continue\nthroughout the years. Ceramic mufflers mean no repair bills for the life of\nyour car. Chemically-protected paper means you can hand your prize\nbooks down to your children. Quick-frozen food means you can retain\ntaste and vitamins for months aÓÇùer your purchase.\nBy sharpening the reader‚Äôs mental picture of that performance. ÓÅ¢e\nRolls-Royce must give you perfect riding silence because every metal part\nof the chassis is shielded from every other metal part by a protective coat\nof rubber. Helena Rubenstein‚Äôs new face cream must make your skin look\nyounger because it contains the placenta of living animals.\nAnd, above all, by giving your product‚Äôs claim of performance a fresh\nnew basis for believability. ÓÅ¢is is the most important use of the physical\nproduct in \u0000elds where a new \u0000rm or product is attempting to invade an\nestablished Mass Instinct \u0000eld. Others have made the same claim before.\nYour product, in order to pull sales away from them, must introduce a\nnew mechanism that performs the claim, or a new quality that assures its\n\nperformance, or a new freedom from old limitations that improves the\nperformance. ÓÅ¢is is the point of difference‚ÄîoÓÇùen conceived by the copy\nwriter, and built by the manufacturer into the product at his\nrecommendation. We shall discuss this point of difference quite\nthoroughly in the next few chapters.\nSo much for the physical product. It is always subordinated to the\nfunctional product‚Äîthe product in action‚Äîwhat the product does.\nIt is the performance of your product, satisfying the mass desire of your\nmarket, which provides the selling power of your ad.\nYour \u0000rst task, then, in studying your product, is to list the number of\ndifferent performances it contains‚Äîto group these performances against\nthe mass desires that each of them satis\u0000es‚Äîand then to feature the one\nperformance that will harness the greatest sales power onto your product\nat that particular time. Take the automobile, for example. Every\nautomobile offers its prospective owner several different and distinct sets\nof performances:\nIt offers him transportation. ÓÅ¢e ability to carry himself, his family, his\nluggage, and perhaps (in the case of station wagons) his pets and his\nfurniture from place to place.\nIt offers him dependability. ÓÅ¢e freedom from breakdown, stalling,\npoor performance, repair bills, embarrassment and inconvenience.\nIt offers him economy. Inexpensive transportation: savings in both gas\nand oil; freedom from repair bills, seen this time from the point of view\nof the pocket book: durability high trade-in value, low insurance cost.\nIt offers him power. Number of horses at his command; take-off at the\nlights: acceleration on hills and in traffic; top speed, even if he never uses\nit. All adding up to a feeling of dominance on the highway.\nIt offers him recognition. Admiration, status, subtle and accepted\nbragging, envy, the feeling of having arrived. ÓÅ¢e oohs and ahhs of his\nneighbors, the \u0000rst ride, the very smell of a new car.\nIt offers him value. ÓÅ¢e number of feet of steel he can command for\nthe price. High trade-in value over the years. ÓÅ¢e fact that the car can last\nfor 100,000 miles, even if he can afford to trade it in every year.\nIt offers him novelty. Power steering \u0000ve years ago‚Äîelectric door\nlocks today. ÓÅ¢ree-tone paint jobs yesterday‚Äîiridescent paints now. ÓÅ¢e\nthrill of being the leader, the pace-setter, the proven pioneer.\nAnd many more. Some of them hidden, never admitted, discovered\nonly recently by motivation research. Dozens of different performances,\n\nbuilt into the same product, each of them reaching out and tapping a\ndifferent desire‚Äîa distinct public.\nAnd yet your ad can feature only one of these performances; can\neffectively tap only one mass desire at a time.\nYour headline is limited by physical space. You have only one glance\nof the reader‚Äôs eye to stop him. He is preoccupied; he is not looking for\nyour product or your message‚Äîthe span of his attention will admit only\none thought to penetrate his indifference during that glance.\nIf your \u0000rst thought holds him, he will read the second. If the second\nholds him, he will read the third. And if the third thought holds him, he will\nprobably read through your ad.\nEvery product gives you dozens of keys. But only one will \u0000t the lock.\nYour job is to \u0000nd that one dominant performance, squeeze every drop of\npower out of it in your presentation‚Äîand then convince your reader that\nthat performance and that satisfaction can come only from your product.\nÓÅ¢e next four chapters will show you how to locate that one dominant\nperformance, and how to fashion it into your headline. Once you have\nwritten that headline, then even other performance contained in your\nproduct simply reinforces and documents that main appeal, in exactly the\nsame way as the physical product facts listed above.\n\n2\n-\nYOUR PROSPECT‚ÄôS STATE OF AWARENESS\n‚ÄîHOW TO CAPITALIZE ON IT WHEN YOU\nWRITE YOUR HEADLINE\nYou have now completed the \u0000rst two stages in writing your ad. You\nhave de\u0000ned the mass desire that makes up your market‚Äîfor example,\nthe desire to lose weight, shared by millions of women all over America.\nAnd you have selected the one performance in your product that satis\u0000es\nthat desire most deeply‚Äîfor example, a liquid meal in a glass, delicious,\n\u0000lling, already measured for you‚Ä¶ as easy and pleasant to drink as a\nchocolate malted.\nÓÅ¢is de\u0000nition of your market, and the selection of the product\nperformance most likely to capture that market, forms the core concept, or\ntheme, of your ad. You now know where you are going to start‚Äîwith\nyour market; and where you are going to end‚Äîwith your product. ÓÇªe\nbridge between these two‚Äîtheir meeting place‚Äîis your ad.\nYour ad always begins with your market, and leads that market\ninevitably into your product. ÓÅ¢e beginning of your ad‚Äîyour headline‚Äîis\nthe \u0000rst step in this process. ÓÅ¢erefore it concerns itself entirely with your\nmarket. It may never even mention your product or its performance. It is\nbased entirely on the answer to these three questions:\n1. What is the mass desire that creates this market? (Which we have\nalready discovered.)\n2. How much do these people know today about the way your product\nsatis\u0000es this desire? (ÓÅ¢eir State of Awareness.)\n3. How many other products have been presented to them before yours?\n(ÓÅ¢eir State of Sophistication.)\nÓÅ¢e answer to question 1 gives you the nationwide force that creates\nyour market. ÓÅ¢e answer to questions 2 and 3 gives you the location of\nthat market in relation to your product. Your strategy for exploiting or\novercoming the answers to these last two questions will give you the\ncontent of your headline. Let‚Äôs \u0000rst re-de\u0000ne the job we are going to ask\nour headline to do, and then see how each of these last two questions tells\nus what that headline should‚Äîand should not‚Äîsay.\nYour Headline‚Äôs Real Job\n\nÓÅ¢ere has been much confusion about how much of a selling job your\nheadline should be required to do. Actually, your headline does not need to\nsell at all. It does not have to mention your product. It does not even have\nto mention your main appeal. To demand that a headline should do any\nof these is to place the full selling burden on approximately 10% to 20%\nof the total physical space of your ad ‚Ä¶ that physical space taken up by\nthe headline itself.\nYour headline has only one job‚Äîto stop your prospect and compel him\nto read the second sentence of your ad. In exactly the same way, your\nsecond sentence has only one job‚Äîto force him to read the third\nsentence of your ad. And the third sentence‚Äîand every additional\nsentence in your ad‚Äîhas exactly the same job.\nIt is simply common sense that the more of your story you can force\nyour prospect to read, the more thoroughly you can sell him. To attempt\nto do the same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a\nthousand, is to shoot craps with your client‚Äôs money. You might as well\nbuy only enough space to print your headline, and use the rest of the\nbudget for repeat insertions.\nIt is the copy writer‚Äôs job to force the prospect to read his client‚Äôs full\nstory‚Äînot just a skimmed version of it. Only to prospects actively\nseeking the client‚Äôs speci\u0000c brand-name product, and in a case where you\ncan offer them a special price reduction, can your headline do the full\nselling job. To attempt a complete selling job with any other kind of\nheadline is simply to admit defeat.\nWhat Your Prospect‚Äôs State of Awareness\nDemands From Your Headline\nWe have already assumed that the only reader you are looking for is\nthe prospect for your product. ÓÅ¢at means that he shares a de\u0000ned desire\nwith thousands, and perhaps even millions, of other people all over\nAmerica. But how much aware is that prospect of that desire? How close is\nit to the surface of his consciousness? Is he aware only that a problem or\nneed exists, or is he aware if they can be satis\u0000ed? And if he is aware that a\nmeans of satisfaction exists, does he realize that it lies in your group of\nproducts, or speci\u0000cally in your product by name, or more speci\u0000cally in\nyour product at a given price?\n\nÓÅ¢e answer to these questions will help you determine the State of\nAwareness of your market‚Äîtheir present state of knowledge about your\nproduct and the satisfaction that your product performs. It is at this\nprecise point of awareness that your headline begins.\nIn its natural development, every market‚Äôs awareness passes through\nseveral stages. ÓÅ¢e more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the\nless you need to say. Let‚Äôs go down the awareness scale step by step. We‚Äôll\nstart at the Most Aware‚Äîthe most mechanical selling job‚Äîand proceed\nto more and more difficult problems, requiring more and more creative\nsolutions.\n1. ÓÅ¢e Most Aware\nÓÅ¢e customer knows of your product‚Äîknows what it does‚Äîknows\nhe wants it. At this point, he just hasn‚Äôt gotten around to buying it yet.\nYour headline‚Äîin fact, your entire ad‚Äîneed state little more except the\nname of your product and a bargain price. For example:\n‚ÄúRevere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera‚ÄîFormerly $149.50‚ÄîNow\nOnly $119.95.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢e remainder of the advertisement can summarize quickly the most\ndesirable selling points. ÓÅ¢en add the name of a store, or a coupon, and\nclose.\nÓÅ¢is is the typical department store, discount store, mail-order-\nbargain-catalog type of advertising. It takes advantage of the full weight\nof all the advertising that has been done on the same product before it. Its\naddition‚Äîits news‚Äîis the price‚Äîor a free giÓÇù‚Äîor instant delivery‚Äîor\nproximity in the neighborhood. Its prospect is fully aware‚Äîhe has all the\ninformation he needs. Here the copy writer is nothing more than the\nmerchandise manager‚Äôs phrase-maker. ÓÅ¢e price is the most important\npart of his headline. ÓÅ¢ere is nothing creative about his job, and he\nshould receive the lowest possible scale of pay.\n2. ÓÅ¢e Customer Knows of the Product\nBut Doesn‚Äôt Yet Want It\n\nHere, your prospect isn‚Äôt completely aware of all your product does, or\nisn‚Äôt convinced of how well it does it, or hasn‚Äôt yet been told how much\nbetter it does it now.\nHere‚Äîin the approach to this market‚Äîis the great bulk of all\nadvertising. Here you are dealing with a product which is known‚Äîwhich\nhas established a brand name‚Äîwhich has already linked itself with an\nacknowledged public desire, and has proven that it satis\u0000ed that desire.\nHere your headline is faced with one of seven tasks:\na) To reinforce your prospects desire for your product;\nb) To sharpen his image of the way your product\nsatis\u0000es that desire;\nc) To extend his image of where and when your product\nsatis\u0000es that desire;\nd) To introduce new proof, details, documentation of\nhow well your product satis\u0000es that desire;\ne) To announce a new mechanism in that product to\nenable it to satisfy that desire even better;\nf) To announce a new mechanism in your product that\neliminates former limitations;\ng) Or to completely change the image or the mechanism\nof that product, in order to remove it from the\ncompetition of other products claiming to satisfy the\nsame desire.\nIn all seven cases, the approach is the same. You display the name of\nthe product‚Äîeither in the headline or in an equally large logo‚Äîand use\nthe remainder of the headline to point out its superiority. ÓÅ¢e body of the\nad is then an elaboration of that superiority‚Äîincluding visualization,\ndocumentation, and mechanization. When you have \u0000nished weaving in\nevery strand of your product‚Äôs superiority, your ad is done. Here are\nsample headlines presenting solutions to all seven of the problems of this\nstate of awareness:\n(a) To reinforce your prospect‚Äôs desire for your product‚Äîby using:\nASSOCIATION:\n‚ÄúSteinway‚ÄîThe Instrument of the Immortals.‚Äù\n‚ÄúJoy‚ÄîThe Costliest Perfume in the World.‚Äù\n\nYOUR PROSPECT‚ÄôS STATE OF AWARENESS\n‚ÄúWhich Twin Has the Toni?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHair Coloring So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure‚ÄîMiss\nClairol.‚Äù\nSENSORY SHARPENING\n‚ÄúTastes like you just picked it‚ÄîDole.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe skin YOU love to touch‚ÄîWoodbury‚Äù\nILLUSTRATION:\n(Anyone of the thousands of superb pictorial ads in the food, fashion,\ncosmetic, jewelry and similar industries. Perhaps best summed up by Life\nSaver‚Äôs classic headline, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt lick this page.‚Äù)\n(b) To sharpen your prospect‚Äôs image of the way your product satis\u0000es\nthat desire (Much like the sensory sharpening illustrated above; but\nconcentrating here on the physical product itself, or on the mechanism by\nwhich it works):\n‚ÄúAt 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royce is the electric\nclock.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the\nbelly of a fish.‚Äù\n(c) To extend his image of where and when your product satis\u0000es that\ndesire:\n‚ÄúAnywhere you go. Hertz is always nearby‚Äù\n‚ÄúThirst knows no season‚Äù‚Äîin a winter ad, at a time when cold drinks\nwere only consumed during the summer‚ÄîCoca Cola.\n(d) To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your\nproduct satis\u0000es that desire:\n‚Äú9 out of 10 screen stars use Lux Toilet Soap for their priceless smooth\nskins.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJake La Motta, 160-lb fighter, fails to flatten Mono paper cup.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIn Boston, the #1 tea-drinking city, the #1 tea is Salada.‚Äù\n(e) To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy\nthat desire even better:\n‚ÄúHoover's new invention washes floors and vacuums up the scrub\nwater.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWorlds only dog food that makes its own gravy‚ÄîGaines Gravy Train.‚Äù\n(f) To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates\nformer limitations:\n‚ÄúYou breathe no dusty odors when YOU do it with Lewyt.‚Äù\n‚ÄúA new Zenith hearing aid‚Äîinconspicuous beyond belief.‚Äù\n(g) Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of the product,\nin order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to\nsatisfy the same desire.\nHere we are dealing with the State of Sophistication of our market‚Äî\nthe amount of exposure they have already had to similar products. Every\nproduct during its life history encounters this problem. All of Chapter 3\nwill be devoted to some of the approaches to its solution.\nWe now move on to the less aware markets‚Äîwith their more difficult\ncopy challenges, and their greater demand for the unprecedented.\n3. How to Introduce New Products\nÓÇªe prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants\nwhat the product does; but he doesn‚Äôt yet know that there is a product‚Äî\nyour product‚Äîthat will do it for him.\nHere the problem is two-fold. First, to pinpoint the ill-de\u0000ned, as-yet-\nuncrystallized desire that is slowly spreading through great masses of\npeople all over America. And second, to crystallize that desire, and its\nsolution, so sharply and so dramatically that each and every prospect will\nrecognize it at a glance.\n\nÓÅ¢e three steps in the process are simple. Name the desire and/or its\nsolution in your headline. Prove that that solution can be accomplished.\nAnd show that the mechanism of that accomplishment is contained in\nyour product.\nHowever, starting with a market in this still-amorphous state of\nawareness, and continuing with each of the more difficult challenges to\ncome, the execution becomes more and more important than the\nmechanics. Here the copy writer contributes more and more to the value\nof the product in the public eye, and to its total volume of sales. Here the\ninnovator comes into play. Here the ratio of salary of copy writer to\nproduction supervisor shoots up abruptly. For this is the domain of the\nidea man.\nWhat are the attributes he needs?\nFirst, analysis. As a copy writer you will \u0000nd it necessary to de\u0000ne the\nparticular market most receptive to your product, its location in relation\nto your product in terms of awareness and sophistication, and the driving\nemotional forces that have created both that market and the potential for\nthe sales of your product within it.\nSecond, intuition, which may be described as the ability to sense a\ntrend at its start, gauge its force and direction, determine the precise\nmoment when it burgeons into a pro\u0000table market.\nAnd third, verbal creativity, as discussed in the next three chapters,\nand throughout the rest of the book. ÓÅ¢e ability to give a name to the\nstill-unde\u0000ned. To capture a feeling, a hope, a desire, a fear in words. To\ncreate a catchword or a slogan. To focus emotion, and give it a goal.\nLet us see how great writers in the past have taken these amorphous\ndesires, and brought them into razor-sharp focus in a single statement in\ntheir headline:\n‚ÄúLight a Lucky, and you‚Äôll never miss sweets that make you fat.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWho else wants a whiter wash‚Äîwith no hard work?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow to win friends and influence people.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo men who want to quit work some day.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhen doctors feel rotten‚Äîthis is what they do.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNow! Run your car without spark plugs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhoever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant??‚Äù\nAnd dozens more. Here, amorphous desire has been crystallized in\nthe headline. ÓÅ¢en sharpened and expanded in the \u0000rst few paragraphs;\nsatis\u0000ed and documented in the body of the ad: and focused inevitably\non the product throughout.\nSometimes the simplest statement of the desire is the best. ‚ÄúHow to\nwin friends and influence people‚Äù needs no verbal twist to increase its\nimpact. At other times, the desire itself must be reinforced by fresh proof\nthat it can be achieved, ‚ÄúWhen doctors feel rotten‚Äîthis is what they\ndo‚Äù. Or by mystery, ‚ÄúNow! Run your car without spark plugs!‚Äù Or by\nwonderment, ‚ÄúWho ever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant?‚Äù\nÓÅ¢e next two chapters will discuss, \u0000rst, the strategy of determining when\nto use a fresh approach; and second, how to sharpen that \u0000rst statement\nof desire with verbalization.\n4. How to Introduce Products ÓÅ¢at Solve Needs\nÓÇªe prospect has‚Äînot a desire‚Äîbut a need. He recognizes the need\nimmediately. But he doesn‚Äôt yet realize the connection between the\nful\u0000llment of that need and your product.\nÓÅ¢is is the problem-solving ad. It might be thought of as a special case\nof the desire ad mentioned above, since the technique of writing it is so\nsimilar. Here you start by naming the need and/or its solution in your\nheadline. ÓÅ¢en dramatize the need so vividly that the prospect realizes\njust how badly he needs the solution. And then present your product as\nthe inevitable solution.\nAgain, this type of ad runs from the most naked statement of the\nneed alone, to the most complicated verbal twists to bring it to the peak\nof impact. To start at the beginning, the most effective possible headline\nfor your particular problem may be as simple as this:\n‚ÄúCorns?‚Äù\nHere, only the problem itself is mentioned‚Äînothing more. Or it may\nbe necessary to state both problem and solution immediately:\n‚ÄúStops maddening itch.‚Äù\n\nMany headlines in this category promise the removal of previously\nunconquerable limitations. ÓÅ¢ey are especially popular in catalog selling:\n‚ÄúLets portable transistor radios play on ordinary household current.‚Äù\nAnd many combine all three elements‚Äîthe problem, its solution, and\nthe removal of the usually expected limitations:\n‚ÄúShrinks hemorrhoids without surgery.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢ere are headlines which promise substitutes for unpleasant or\nexpensive tasks:\n‚ÄúNow! A ring and piston job in a tube!‚Äù\nAnd there are headlines which promise to prevent a future problem,\nbefore it can occur:\n‚ÄúLook, Mom! No cavities!‚Äù\nBut many times the problem is not so clearly de\u0000ned, not so\nobviously on the surface. You may know the general area of the problem\n‚Äîfor example, people‚Äôs embarrassment at speaking poor English. But you\nmay not be sure of which avenue is the most effective in reaching them.\nHere the emphasis of a single word‚Äîthe emotional sharpening of an\nalready easily-identi\u0000ed image‚Äîprovides the answer:\n‚ÄúDo YOU make these mistakes in English?‚Äù\nAnd, where the solution to the need has been promised before‚Äî\nwhere the direct statement of the solution has lost its force and freshness\n‚Äîthen verbal twists are needed to restore that novelty:\n‚ÄúHow a bald-headed barber helped save my hair.‚Äù\n5. How to Open Up a Completely Unaware\nMarket\nAnd \u0000nally‚Äîthe most difficult. ÓÇªe prospect is either not aware of his\ndesire or his need‚Äîor he won‚Äôt honestly admit it to himself without being\nlead into it by your ad‚Äîor the need is so general and amorphous that it\n\nresists being summed up in a single headline‚Äîor it‚Äôs a secret that just can‚Äôt\nbe verbalized.\nÓÅ¢is is the outer reach of the awareness scale. ÓÅ¢ese are the people\nwho are still the logical prospects for your product; and yet, in their own\nminds, they are hundreds of miles away from accepting that product. It is\nyour job to bridge that gap.\nLet me repeat what I said when we \u0000rst began to explore these \u0000ve\nstages of awareness. Each of these stages is separated from the others by a\npsychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference; on the other,\nintense interest. A headline that works wonders in the \u0000rst stage‚Äîfor\nexample, ‚ÄúDial Soap - 9c a cake!‚Äù‚Äîwill fail completely when addressed to\na third-stage market where your prospect doesn‚Äôt even realize that soaps\ncan be made with built-in deodorants. And a third-stage headline‚Äîfor\nexample, ‚ÄúWho else wants a whiter wash with no hard work?‚Äù‚Äîwill be\nold-hat, no-news to today‚Äôs housewife, who has been barraged by whiter-\nthan-white advertising for twenty years.\nTo sum up, then‚Äîa headline which will work to a market in one stage\nof awareness will not work to a market in another stage of awareness. Nor\nwill it work, even to a market in which it has been successful, once that\nmarket passes on to a new stage of awareness.\nMost products are designed to satisfy a speci\u0000c need or desire. ÓÅ¢ey\nare born into markets that are at least the third or fourth stages of\nawareness. ÓÅ¢ey may therefore never be faced with the problem of an\nunaware market.\nHowever, many products actually pass out of public awareness or out\nof public acceptance at some time or other during their life histories. ÓÅ¢e\ndesire they satisfy dries up, or other products serve it better, or they are\nbranded ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù.\nAgain, we are dealing with a matter of statistics. When a product\nbegins to slip ‚Ä¶ when volume falls off, even though advertising budgets\nare increased ‚Ä¶ when the name of the product no longer sells as much ‚Ä¶\nwhen a direct statement of the product's function no longer sells as much\n‚Ä¶ when a direct statement of the desire or the need that the product\nful\u0000lls no longer sells as much‚Äîthen that product needs to be reborn, and\nits problem is the problem of opening up an unaware market.\nAgain, this is the most difficult, the most challenging problem of all.\nÓÅ¢ere are few positive milestones to guide you. But fortunately there are\nsome completely self-evident negative rules that can eliminate many\n\nblind alleys, and set you face to face against your task. Planning a\nheadline for a completely unaware or resistant market, then, is \u0000rst of all\na process of elimination. Here are the \u0000rst paths:\n1. Price means nothing to a person who does not know your product,\nor want your product. ÓÅ¢erefore, eliminate all mention of price, or price\nreduction, in your headline or prime display type.\n2. ÓÅ¢e name of your product means nothing to a person who has\nnever seen it before, and may actually damage your ad if you have had a\nbad model the year before, or if it is now associated with the antiquated,\nthe unfashionable, or the unpleasant. ÓÅ¢erefore, keep your product out of\nthe headline, and be extremely wary about breaking the mood or disguise\nof your ad with a prominent logo.\n3. And this is the hardest fact of all to accept. At this stage of your\nmarket, a direct statement of what your product does, what desire it\nsatis\u0000es, or what problem it solves, simply will not work. Your product\neither has not reached that direct stage, or has passed beyond it. And you\ncannot simply shiÓÇù from one desire to another. You are not faced here\nwith a problem of sophistication, but one of complete indifference, or\nunacceptability. ÓÅ¢erefore, the performance of your product, and the\ndesire it satis\u0000es, can only be brought in later. You cannot mention them\nin your headline.\nSo you cannot mention price, product, function or desire. What do\nyou have leÓÇù? Your market, of course! And the distinct possibility that by\nbroadening your appeal beyond price, product function or speci\u0000c desire,\nyou can reach the maximum limits of your full potential market;\nconsolidate splinter appeals; and increase the sales of your product at a\nfantastic rate.\nOnce you have accepted the challenge of writing this kind of ad, then\nyour product and its attributes fade into the background, and you\nconcentrate exclusively on the state of mind of your market at this\nparticular moment. What you are doing essentially in this \u0000ÓÇùh stage is\ncalling your market together in the headline of your ad. You are writing an\nidenti\u0000cation headline. You are selling nothing, promising nothing,\nsatisfying nothing. Instead, you are echoing an emotion, an attitude, a\nsatisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds them\ntogether in a single statement.\nIn this type of headline, you are telling them what they are. You are\nde\u0000ning them for themselves. You are giving them the information they\n\nneed and want, about a problem still so vague that you are the \u0000rst to put\nit into words.\nHere, above all, is the type of headline that never attempts to sell a\nproduct or a performance, but simply tries to sell the remainder of the ad\nitself‚Äîthe information that follows on the page. ÓÅ¢e only function of this\nheadline is to get the prospect to read the next paragraph. And this\nsecond paragraph pulls him into the third; and the third into the fourth:\nand right on down the page, paragraph aÓÇùer paragraph.\nMeanwhile these paragraphs are building a steady progression of\nlogical images, from the \u0000rst identi\u0000cation with the headline, to a\ngrowing awareness of the problem or the desire to the realization that a\nsolution is at hand, and to the inevitable focusing of that desire and that\nsolution onto your particular product.\nÓÅ¢is, then, is the general strategy of dealing with an unaware market.\nÓÅ¢e application of this strategy, when all direct methods have failed, has\nproduced hundreds of great headlines. It would be impossible to classify\nall of them, since each solution establishes its own new pattern. However,\nthere are de\u0000nite landmarks and directions we can distinguish. Here are\nsome of them‚Äîstarting with the general principle they used, then the\nproblem they solved, then the headline itself, and then the most\nimportant structural paragraph of body copy:\nGiving Words to a Hidden Dream\nProblem: to expand the market for home correspondence courses\nbeyond that obtained by ‚ÄúEarn more money‚Äù and ‚ÄúGain more skill‚Äù\nheadlines.

ÓÅ¢e solution:\nWHY MEN CRACK‚Ä¶\nAn authority of international standing recently wrote;\n‚ÄúYou have overeaten and plugged your organs with\nmoderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only\nalcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nYou know them.

ÓÅ¢e solution:\nHERE‚ÄôS AN EXTRA $50, GRACE‚Äî\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm making real money now!‚Äù\n‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve been keeping it a secret until pay day came.\nI‚Äôve been promoted with an increase of $50 a month. And\nthe first extra money is yours. Just a little reward for\nurging me to study at home. The boss saw my spare time\ntraining has made me a valuable man to the firm and\nthere‚Äôs more money coming soon. We‚Äôre starting up easy\nstreet, Grace, thanks to you and the I.C.S‚Ä¶‚Äù\nÓÅ¢e List Never Ends\nEvery day new solutions, new patterns are being created. Wherever\nthe direct appeal fails, or loses its power, you should begin to explore a\n\u0000ÓÇùh stage headline.\nHowever, there are two vital points to remember in connection with\nthis problem. First of all, this type of headline is in\u0000nitely more difficult\nto bring home to the target than any of the other four types. You are far\nmore likely to miss the mark on this headline, because you have far fewer\n\nguideposts to direct you. Your headline no longer refers to your product,\nbut it must therefore refer even more strongly to your market. It cannot\nsimply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous, or cute. Nor can\nit mask the fact that it has no headline behind a pretty picture. Most copy\nwriters use a \u0000ÓÇùh stage problem to write an empty headline, and are\ntherefore simply wasting their client‚Äôs money.\nBecause it is so easy to wander off into an irrelevant headline, keep\nthis one cardinal rule in mind. Your prospect must identify with your\nheadline before he can buy from it. It must be his headline, his problem,\nhis state of mind at that particular moment. It must pick out the product‚Äôs\nlogical prospects‚Äîand reject as many people as it attracts.\nAnd, if it is an effective headline, and it works, then it too will become\noutdated as your market moves on to a new stage of awareness. And you\nwill be presented with another problem, just as challenging, and just as\nrewarding, as the one you have solved before. You never step in the same\nriver twice. No market ever stands still.\nA Final Word on Style in Advertising Copy\nMarkets change; desires change; fashions change. And so do the\nacceptable styles of advertisements change. Certain advertising styles‚Äî\nthe form your advertising message takes‚Äîgrow tired with time‚Äîthen\nstale‚Äîthen actually laughable. At the turn of the century, effective ads\nwere written in verse; twenty years later, no one would believe them. In\nthe 1920s most of the great ads were narrative stories‚Äîeither \u0000rst-person\nconfessions, or third person revelations, or comic strips dramatizations.\nToday everything but the comic strip is gone‚Äîand we see less and less of\nit every year. When a new style is born, people believe it, and it reinforces\nthe message it is carrying. When that same style grows trite, people\ncannot see the message for the advertisement.\nWe‚Äôll explore this subject further, in the chapters discussing Mood\nand Disguise in writing advertisements. Meanwhile, one more note here.\nIn effective advertising, though styles may change, strategy does not.\nIf you will study the piano and bridesmaid ads in this chapter, you will\nnotice this: ÓÅ¢at while the narrative style of both is now old-hat, you can\nstill respond to their power. Both tap desires that still exist‚Äîthough now\nperhaps directed toward different products and different problems. And\nboth evoke those desires, and channel those desires, so effectively, that if\n\nthey were rewritten in today‚Äôs idiom, and applied to different products,\nthey still might sell millions of dollars‚Äô worth of goods today.\n\n3\n-\nTHE SOPHISTICATION OF YOUR MARKET:\nHOW MANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN\nTHERE BEFORE YOU?\nAs we mentioned before, in Chapter 2, there are three questions you\nmust answer before you can determine what goes into your headline.\nÓÅ¢ese are:\n1. What is the mass desire that motivates your market?\n2. How much does your market know about your product?\n(ÓÇªeir State of Awareness.)\n3. How many similar products have they been told about\nbefore? (ÓÇªeir State of Sophistication.)\nÓÅ¢is third question is the most easily answered. A few hours research\nshould give you samples of every competing ad in the \u0000eld‚Äîif there are\nany.\nIf You Are First in Your Market\nIf there are not‚Äîif you are the \u0000rst in your particular market, with\nyour particular product‚Äîthen you are dealing with prospects that have\nno sophistication about your product at all. In other words, they have\nnever received any information about such a product before. Once you\nget them interested, they are likely to become much more enthusiastic,\nbelieve much more of what you have to say, and buy that much more\nreadily. Remember, your story is brand-new to them.\nÓÅ¢is, of course, is the dream of every manufacturer and every copy\nwriter. To be \u0000rst. And it happens quite oÓÇùen today. Sometimes because of\na technological breakthrough‚Äîcreating a new product (women‚Äôs hair\nsprays), or a radically better product (long-playing records), or a familiar\nproduct at an explosively low price (the Model T Ford).\nAnd sometimes, such a brand-new market is created by the insight of\nan advertising man, dealing with an already-established product. In this\ncase, the ad man visualizes the application of the product to an entirely\ndifferent market (the switch, in the Twenties, of Ovaltine from an aid for\ninsomnia to a body builder for skinny children).\nOr he reaches that market through a hitherto untapped medium\n(Revlon‚Äôs fabulous results from sponsorship of ‚ÄúÓÅ¢e $64,000 Question‚Äù in\nthe early days of TV).\n\nOr he discovers a previously unnoticed performance of his product\nthat carries it completely beyond the limits of its old market (Lifebuoy‚Äôs\ndiscovery that people would accept its strong medicinal odor as a cure for\nperspiration odor, and their subsequent christening of that odor with the\ncatch-word ‚ÄúB.O.‚Äù).\nWhen such a golden opportunity‚Äîto be \u0000rst‚Äîpresents itself, you are\nprobably dealing with a market in its third or fourth stage of awareness.\nYour prospects know that they would like what your product does, or\nthey would like to get rid of the problem your product solves‚Äîif it were\nonly possible.\nHere, the answer to your third question is quite simple. You are\ndealing with a market where you are \u0000rst. ÓÅ¢erefore they have no\nprevious information about similar products. ÓÅ¢erefore they are\ncompletely unsophisticated.\nAnd your exploitation of this answer‚Äîyour strategy in approaching\nthis market‚Äîis equally simple:\n1. Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don‚Äôt be fancy. Name either the need\nor the claim in your headline‚Äînothing more. Dramatize that claim in your\ncopy‚Äîmake it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and\nprove that it works.\nNothing more‚Äîbecause nothing more is needed. To illustrate, let‚Äôs\nlook at one of the most pro\u0000table, insatiable, constantly-renewing, and\ntherefore overworked \u0000elds in marketing history: the reducing \u0000eld. No\none knows who was the \u0000rst man to stumble on the reducing \u0000eld\n(though it‚Äôs fairly certain that he must have become a millionaire). But all\nhe had to say in his headline was a simple statement of the direct desire of\nmillions of women:\n‚ÄúNOW! LOSE UGLY FAT!‚Äù\nAs he started to clean up, others inevitably followed. But, by this time,\nthe reducing \u0000eld had already been tapped. Advertisements had been\nrun. ÓÅ¢e direct claim had been made. Mere repetition would no longer be\nenough. In other words, the reducing market was now in its Second Stage\nof Sophistication. A new approach was necessary. ÓÅ¢e strategy had to be\nchanged‚Äîto this:\nIf You‚Äôre Second, Do ÓÅ¢is\n\nIf you‚Äôre second, and the direct claim is still working‚Äîthen copy that\nsuccessful claim‚Äîbut enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid\nyour competition.\nFor example, here are two successful headlines in the now \u0000ercely-\ncompetitive reducing \u0000eld that did just that. ÓÅ¢ey have both been pushed\nto the outer limits of both legality and believability. But they both\nworked.\n‚ÄúLOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS‚ÄîOR RECEIVE $40 BACK!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER ‚Ä¶ NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.‚Äù\nIn most \u0000elds, this enlarged-claim technique reaches the outer limits\nin successive stages. Sometimes the completion of this process takes\nyears. In the home garden \u0000eld, as another example, an advertiser\nbrought out a Floribunda Rose‚Äîusing this headline with startling\nsuccess:\n‚ÄúPICK 25‚Äî50‚Äî100 ROSES FROM THIS ONE MAGNIFICENT PLANT!‚Äù\nIt worked. And so, some years later, a special variety of cushion mum\nswept the country with this headline:\n‚ÄúSIX HUNDRED MUMS FROM A SINGLE BUSH!‚Äù\nAnd, one year later, this headline carried the process to what are\nprobably the absolute limits of Mother Nature:\n‚ÄúWHO EVER HEARD OF 17,000 BLOOMS FROM A SINGLE PLANT?‚Äù\nAs simple as this evolution looks, it produces results. It provided a\ntremendous liÓÇù to car sales in the 1950s, when 50 more horsepower was\nadded to the advertisements every year. It was climaxed in the Chrysler\n300‚Äîa car named aÓÇùer its horsepower rating‚Äîand pegged just at the\nlimit of believability, practicality, and the inevitable public reaction.\nFor the reaction will come. Toward the end, the process disintegrates.\nÓÅ¢e successful claim is overworked; enlargement piles on enlargement.\nNew competitors enter the \u0000eld‚Äîeach trying to promise more. Headlines\ndouble and triple in size. Words begin to lose their meaning‚Äî‚Äúwhiter-\nthan-whites‚Äù appear. ÓÅ¢e prospect becomes confused‚Äîthen skeptical.\nBelievability is shattered; claims are automatically discounted 50% by\n\ntheir readers. More promise is poured in to compensate. ÓÅ¢e government\nbegins to investigate. And the sales curve begins to turn down-down-\ndown.\nÓÅ¢e ÓÅ¢ird Stage of Sophistication\nAt this point, your market has entered into its ÓÅ¢ird Stage of\nSophistication. Your prospects have now heard all the claims‚Äîall the\nextremes. Perhaps they have even bought one or two competitive\nproducts. Every time they open a newspaper, another similar headline\nscreams out at them. How are they to distinguish one product from the\nmass? How do you break through to reach them?\nOne factor is vital here. ÓÅ¢at is the restorative power of the market you\nare dealing with. It may be a market based on a constantly recurring mass\ninstinct, such as reducing. It may be a market based on an unsolved\ntechnological problem, such as spark plug replacement. It may be a\nmarket that periodically wishes to renew or improve its purchases, such\nas cars, homes, appliances. In all these cases, the desire never fades; the\nmarket continually renews itself. New prospects come into the market.\nOld customers become dissatis\u0000ed with their old purchases, their old\nsolutions, and begin to look again. ÓÅ¢e mass desire‚Äîthe tremendous\npro\u0000t potential‚Äîstill exists. But it cannot be tapped by the old, simple\nmethods any longer.\nWomen still want to lose weight. But by now they‚Äôve read dozens of\nads for reducing aids‚Äîall promising them to take off 20, 30, 40 pounds in\na matter of weeks. ÓÅ¢ey no longer fully believe them. Perhaps they believe\nthese ads so little that they won‚Äôt even try a new product at all. For\nmonths, even years, they may simply accept their overweight condition as\n‚Äúsomething that just can‚Äôt be helped.‚Äù\nBut the desire never fades. ÓÅ¢e dissatisfaction builds up, month aÓÇùer\nmonth. Secretly, perhaps even unconsciously, these women are hoping to\n\u0000nd a new product‚Äîa new headline‚Äîthat promises them a new way to\nsatisfy that age-old desire.\nAnd on this fundamental fact, we build our strategy for selling a\nmarket in its ÓÅ¢ird Stage of Sophistication.\nIf your market is at the stage where they‚Äôve heard all the claims, in all\ntheir extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won‚Äôt work any longer.\nWhat this market needs now is a new device to make all these old claims\n\nbecome fresh and believable to them again. In other words, A NEW\nMECHANISM‚Äîa new way to making the old promise work. A different\nprocess‚Äîa fresh chance‚Äîa brand-new possibility of success where only\ndisappointment has resulted before.\nHere the emphasis shiÓÇùs from what the product does to HOW it\nworks. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant. ÓÅ¢e\nheadline expands. ÓÅ¢e claim remains‚Äîbut now it is reinforced by the\nmechanism that accomplishes it. In the reducing \u0000eld, for example, the\nlimits of its basic promise had been reached by headlines like this:\n‚ÄúI AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER ‚Ä¶ NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.‚Äù\nNow new leaders emerge‚Äîavoiding the competition of claims‚Äî\nstressing mechanism instead, like this:\n‚ÄúFLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!‚Äù\n‚ÄúFIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!‚Äù\nA vital change has taken place in both these ads‚Äîand in every ad that\ndeals successfully with this ÓÅ¢ird Stage of Sophistication. In the previous,\nSecond-Stage ads, the entire headline was taken up by a complete\nstatement of the main claim. Below it, in smaller type, in either a subhead\nor the body copy, came the mechanism that accomplished the claim.\nOÓÇùen, this mechanism was abbreviated‚Äîsimply mentioned instead of\nbeing explained‚Äîindicated by a sort of shorthand, like this:\n‚ÄúI AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER ‚Ä¶ NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.‚Äù\nRead the Astonishing Experience of New York Food Expert with the\nFamous Eat-and-Reduce Plan.\nIn ÓÅ¢ird-Stage ads, however, this arrangement is completely reversed.\nBy this time, the basic claim has become well-known to almost all its\nprospects‚Äîperhaps even too well-known. ÓÅ¢erefore, this shorthand can\nbe applied to the claim itself. What was before a \u0000ve to ten word headline\ndescribing nothing but the basic claim‚Äî‚ÄúI AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER‚Äù‚Äî\ncan be communicated in a single word in a headline devoted to explaining\nhow this claim is accomplished. For instance:\n‚ÄúFLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!‚Äù\n\nOr:\n‚ÄúFIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!‚Äù\nFirst the mechanism is brought into the headline to establish a point\nof difference‚Äîto make the old claims fresh and believable again. And\nthen‚Äîonce the prospect is told that here is a brand-new chance for\nsuccess‚Äîthen the claim can he restated in full, to make sure that she\nrealizes everything she is getting. Like this:\n‚ÄúFLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!‚Äù\nReleased for the first time! The amazing scientific\ndiscovery that melts up to 37 POUNDS off men and\nwomen‚Äîwithout starvation diets, without a single hungry\nmoment‚Äîwithout even giving up the foods you love!\nOr‚Äîusing the same ÓÅ¢ird-Stage arrangement of mechanism in the\nheadline, and claim elaborated in the lead paragraph‚Äîwe have this ad:\n‚ÄúFIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!‚Äù\nUsed successfully by thousands of physicians! Lose as\nmany pounds as you like without diets, without exercise,\nwithout giving up the kinds of food you love to eat!\nIn both these ads‚Äîand all others like them‚Äîthe promise itself is\nsubordinated to the mechanism which accomplishes that promise. ÓÅ¢is\nmechanism is featured in the headline. When ads such as these are\nsuccessful, you are dealing with a market that is in its ÓÅ¢ird Stage of\nSophistication.\nÓÅ¢e Fourth Stage\nBut you are still in a competitive market, and such ads give only a\ntemporary advantage. Such ads, presenting a new promise, begin a new\ntrend. Within a few months, the ÓÅ¢ird Stage of Sophistication passes into\na Fourth Stage‚Äîa new stage of elaboration and enlargement. But this\ntime, the elaboration is concentrated on the mechanism, rather than on\nthe promise‚Äîlike this:\n\n‚ÄúFIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!‚Äù\nÓÅ¢is Fourth Stage strategy can be summarized like this:\nIf a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the\nsame claim as that performed by your product, and that new mechanism\nannouncement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply\nelaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker,\nsurer; allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations;\npromise extra bene\u0000ts. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar\nto the Second Stage of Sophistication described above. ÓÇªe same strategy\nwill be effective here.\nBut, unfortunately, so will the same limitations. ÓÅ¢e Fourth Stage of\nSophistication, like the Second Stage which it resembles, eventually\npushes itself out of the realm of believability. At this point, further\nelaborations become ineffective. You are then faced with two alternatives:\nFirst, discovering a new, acceptable mechanism to make the promise\nfresh and believable again. But remember, the mechanism you use must\nnot only be new and legitimate, but it must be accepted as believable and\nsigni\u0000cant by your market. Each ÓÅ¢ird and Fourth Stage ad that precedes\nyou, makes this problem of acceptance more and more difficult.\nEventually, of course, no new mechanism will gain acceptance. ÓÅ¢e\nmarket will have grown tired of your promises and the mechanisms by\nwhich they are accomplished. Your prospects will have been glutted by\nadvertising. You will have reached the FiÓÇùh Stage of Sophistication‚Äîthe\nmost difficult‚Äîwhere the \u0000eld is said to be exhausted‚Äîwhere\ncompetitors are dropping out of the market en masse.\nHow to Revive a ‚ÄúDead‚Äù Product\nIn this Final Stage of Sophistication, your market no longer believes\nin your advertising, and therefore no longer wishes to be aware of your\nproduct. In many ways, therefore, this FiÓÇùh Stage of Sophistication\ncorresponds to the FiÓÇùh Stage of Awareness discussed in Chapter 2. ÓÅ¢e\nproblems are the same. ÓÅ¢e strategy is the same. ÓÅ¢e emphasis shiÓÇùs from\nthe promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identi\u0000cation\nwith the prospect himself. You are dealing here with the problem of\nbringing your prospect into your ad‚Äînot through desire‚Äîbut through\nidenti\u0000cation. (See Chapter 8.)\n\nAn outstanding example of a product which had lost its market\nbecause of such a FiÓÇùh Stage of Sophistication, and then gained it back by\na brilliant use of the identi\u0000cation headline, is the Postum ad discussed in\nChapter 2, and its headline, ‚ÄúWHY MEN CRACK ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nLet‚Äôs Look at an Industry ÓÅ¢at Went ÓÅ¢rough All\nFive Stages of Sophistication\nBut perhaps the classic example of an industry which encountered all\n\u0000ve Stages of Sophistication‚Äîand overcame them‚Äîis the Cigarette\nIndustry. ÓÅ¢e history of cigarette advertising is a continuous battle against\ncompetition, against physical and social taboos, even against the very\nsuccess of its own current advertising; which saturates and exhausts the\nmarket by the weight of its combined industry expenditures, and\nconstantly demands new approaches.\nLet‚Äôs brie\u0000y examine the main current of cigarette advertising \u0000rst‚Äî\nthe progression from the \u0000rst to the \u0000ÓÇùh Stages of Sophistication‚Äîand\nthen discuss some of the side problems it encountered.\nIn the First Stage of Sophistication, when the market was new,\ncigarette advertising featured taste, enjoyment, pleasure in the headline:\n‚ÄúI‚ÄôD WALK A MILE FOR A CAMEL!‚Äù\n‚ÄúCHESTERFIELD‚ÄîTHEY SATISFY!‚Äù\nÓÅ¢is raw promise of enjoyment gradually became elaborated and\nembellished to push it to the limits of believability. In this Second Stage,\nsince you cannot measure the pleasure a cigarette gives you, the promise-\ngrowth took the form of broader and broader comparisons:\n‚ÄúLIGHT UP A LUCKY, AND YOU WONT MISS THE SWEETS THAT\nMAKE YOU FAT!‚Äù\nBut, without measurement, the limits of enlargement are soon\nreached. So ÓÅ¢ird-Stage strategy began to be employed‚Äîa continuous\nstream of brilliant new mechanisms:\n‚ÄúLUCKIES‚ÄîTHEY‚ÄôRE TOASTED!‚Äù\n‚ÄúPALL MALL‚ÄôS GREATER LENGTH FILTERS THE SMOKE FURTHER!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCAMELS‚ÄîPROTECT YOUR T-ZONE!‚Äù\nAnd, as each of these mechanisms was accepted by the buying public,\nthe originators competitors adopted the mechanism and began to\nelaborate on it‚Äîinitiating the Fourth Stage:\n‚ÄúPHILIP MORRIS‚ÄîALL THE HARSHNESS BAKED OUT!‚Äù\n‚ÄúCHESTERFIELD‚ÄîREGULAR AND KING-SIZED TOO!‚Äù\n‚ÄúNINE OUT OF TEN DOCTORS PREFER LUCKIES!‚Äù\nBut eventually the mechanisms lost their potency, and the\ngovernment ruled out the health claims; and in the early FiÓÇùies the\nindustry faced a FiÓÇùh Stage market. But a new marketing tool‚Äî\nMotivation Research‚Äîhad shown them how to reach this market without\nmechanisms or claims, without even headlines, simply by projecting\nstrong visual identi\u0000cations with the virility that the public had accepted\nin a cigarette. For example, any of the Marlboro ‚ÄúVirile Men‚Äù ads. Or\ntheir imitations in Chester\u0000eld, or Camel ads.\nÓÅ¢us we have the full spectrum of sophistication confronting an\nindustry. But cigarette advertisers also encountered two critical side\nproblems. ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst offered them the opportunity of doubling their\nmarket. ÓÅ¢e second, of retaining that huge market in the face of the most\nadverse publicity\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst challenge occurred immediately following the First World\nWar. By this time the old ‚ÄúCoffin Nails‚Äù taboo had been forgotten‚Äîfor\nmen. But there still remained the equally great potential market of\nwomen smokers‚Äîif smoking could be made respectable for women. ÓÅ¢e\ntrend was de\u0000nitely in that direction‚Äîthe urge, the curiosity existed in\nmillions of women in all social classes‚Äîsome respectable women were\nactually daring to smoke in public.\nBut the trend‚ÄîleÓÇù by itself‚Äîwould take years to develop. An\nadvertisement had to be created to accelerate that trend. To make\nsmoking for women not only acceptable, but desirable. To channel the\nvast movement toward liberation and equality of the Twenties as the\ndriving force to open up this huge new market.\nBut such an advertisement could never come right out and suggest\nthat women smoke. It could not even show a woman smoking. Such an\nadvertisement was de\u0000nitely a FiÓÇùh Stage problem‚Äîa problem in\n\nidenti\u0000cation. And it was solved by linking a man and woman in their\nmost appealing connection‚Äîin love‚Äîwith a smoking situation. ÓÅ¢e ad\nshowed a young couple, sitting together on a beach on a moonlit night.\nHe is just lighting up a cigarette‚Äîthe \u0000rst puffs of smoke are just driÓÇùing\ninto the moonlight. She has her face turned toward his, and her words\nmake up the entire headline (and, except for the logo, the entire ad):\n‚ÄúBLOW SOME MY WAY.‚Äù\nNothing more needed to be said. A vast new market‚Äîopened up with\nfour words.\nÓÅ¢e second challenge occurred thirty years later. ÓÅ¢is was the cancer\nof the late FiÓÇùies, which continues into today. It resulted in four reactions:\nFirst, there were cigarette holders, water pipes, ceramic \u0000lters, etc.‚Äînone\nof which succeeded in establishing a national market, since they\nrepresented too much inconvenience, too blatant an admission that the\npurchaser was worried about his smoking.\nSecondly, the scare produced a determined effort in the industry itself\nto conduct its own research, to counteract or correct such claims.\nÓÅ¢ird, it produced a temporary drop in cigarette sales. And, fourth, it\nopened up a vast new market for an already existing product‚Äîthe \u0000lter\ncigarette‚Äîaided by the industry itself, which wisely gambled that\nsmokers would not move out of cigarettes, but simply into a different\nkind of cigarette.\nFilter cigarettes had always existed, as a small, specialty market. But\nnow they were expanded into a mass market. Millions of new prospects,\nwho had never before even considered \u0000lter cigarettes, now sought out\ninformation about them, asked to be told which one to buy, and a new\nmarket opened up. And it started to retrace the same Stages of\nSophistication as its parent market had passed through \u0000ÓÇùy years before:\nFirst Stage:\n‚ÄúKENT‚ÄôS MICRONITE FILTER TRAPS TARS BEFORE THEY REACH\nYOUR LIPS‚Äù\nSecond Stage:\n‚Äú20,000 FILTER TRAPS IN VICEROY!‚Äù\nÓÅ¢ird Stage:\n\n‚ÄúPARLIAMENT‚ÄîTHE MOST IMPORTANT ¬º INCH IN SMOKING\nTODAY‚ÄîNO FILTER FEEDBACK!‚Äù\nFourth Stage:\n‚ÄúTAREYTON‚ÄîDUAL FILTER FOR DOUBLE THE PLEASURE!‚Äù\nAnd the FiÓÇùh Stage‚Äîin an industry-wide stroke of genius‚Äîright\nback to the \u0000avor again:\n‚ÄúWINSTON TASTES GOOD LIKE A CIGARETTE SHOULD!‚Äù\n‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS WHAT‚ÄôS UP FRONT THAT COUNTS!‚Äù\n‚ÄúL & M HAS FOUND THE SECRET THAT UNLOCKS THE FLAVOR!‚Äù\nAnd so it goes. In industry aÓÇùer industry. ÓÅ¢e same life cycle for each\nmarket. ÓÅ¢e same deadly challenges. ÓÅ¢e same willingness to adapt rather\nthan perish.\nA Personal Note\nIn this book I have tried to write a scienti\u0000c study of advertising,\nwithout troubling the reader with whatever personal ethics I myself may\nobserve. Every copy writer who has ever sweated for days to create a new\napproach will know how it feels to see that approach copied overnight by\na competitor. I share every ounce of that feeling. But such events happen\nevery day. And they are effective. ÓÅ¢erefore, examples such as those\ndetailed above must be listed, in all objectivity, as a business strategy that\nhas and will solve competitive problems in a competitive industry. I\ninclude them here‚Äînot as recommendations, but as possible strategies to\nbe chosen or rejected.\n\n4\n-\n38 WAYS TO STRENGTHEN YOUR\nHEADLINE ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR BASIC\nIDEA\nUp to this point, we have been concerned with the strategy of\nplanning copy‚Äîof arriving at the theme of our ad and the content of its\nheadline‚Äîrather than with the techniques of actually writing this copy.\nÓÅ¢e entire second portion of the book will be devoted to these\ntechniques. But we must pause now, and examine one of these techniques\nout of sequence. It is called VERBALIZATION. And it is the art of\nincreasing the impact of a headline by the way in which it is stated.\nEverything we have done so far has helped us obtain the content of\nour headline. We now know what we want to say. And we now have to\ndetermine how to say it.\nÓÅ¢e most obvious way, of course, is simply to state the claim in its\nbarest form. ‚ÄúLose Weight,‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop Corns,‚Äù for example. And if you are\nthe \u0000rst in your \u0000eld, there is no better way.\nBut where you are competitive, or where the thought is too\ncomplicated to be stated simply and directly, then you must reinforce that\nclaim by binding other images to it with the words in which you express it.\nÓÅ¢is is Verbalization. And it can accomplish several different purposes:\n1. It can strengthen the claim‚Äîby enlarging upon it, by measuring it,\nby making it more vivid, etc.\n2. It can make the claim new and fresh again‚Äîby twisting it, changing\nit, presenting it from a different angle, turning it into a narration,\nchallenging the reader with an example, etc.\n3. It can help the claim pull the prospect into the body of the ad‚Äîby\npromising him information about it, by questioning him, by partially\nrevealing mechanism, etc.\nAll of these goals are accomplished by adding variations,\nenlargements or embellishments to the main headline claim of the ad.\nÓÅ¢ese additional images are bound into the main claim by the sentence\nstructure of the headline. ÓÅ¢ey alter the main claim to make it more\neffective.\nÓÅ¢ey are the second creative step in writing the ad. First, we have seen\nhow to determine the appeal itself. And now, how to shape that appeal\ninto its most effective form in the headline. ÓÅ¢ere are, of course, an\nin\u0000nite number of these variations (every good copywriter invents a few\n\nhimself). But there are general patterns that most of them follow. Here\nare some of these guideposts for your own thinking:\n1.

Try to create your own‚Äî\ntomorrow.\n\n5\n-\nSUMMARY: THE ART OF CREATIVE\nPLANNING‚ÄîHOW TO MAKE AN IDEA\nGROW\nNow, let‚Äôs look at a few special headline problems, and then sum up:\nÓÅ¢e ÓÅ¢ree Levels of Creativity\nSomething should be said here about the various approaches copy\nwriters use to dig up a new headline. As far as I can tell, there are three of\nthem:\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst, the shallowest, and the most widespread and ineffective, is\nthe Word-Substitute Technique. Here the copy writer consults a list of\nproven and successful headlines. He then pulls out the original product\nname and substitutes his own; or his own product‚Äôs performance, etc. He\nusually comes up with something like this:\n‚ÄúI‚ÄôD WALK A MILE FOR A CUP OF BLANK COFFEE!‚Äù\n‚ÄúWHY HAVEN‚ÄôT BOAT OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?‚Äù\n‚ÄúFLOATS UGLY PIMPLES RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SKIN!‚Äù\nIf these ads are copied from a similar product, in the same market, at\nthe same time, then their chance of success is good‚Äîespecially if they\nembellish the promise in any way. But if the product, or the market, or\nthe timing is different, then the chances of success diminish\nproportionately. ÓÅ¢ey become Echo Ads‚Äîads that remind people of\nsome other product. ÓÅ¢ey pay no attention to unique product-market-\ntiming relationship that exists at the moment. ÓÅ¢erefore they lose all the\nstrengths that are wrapped up in that relationship. ÓÅ¢ey are the kind of\nads that clients write, rather than copy writers.\nÓÅ¢e second, deeper and more difficult approach is through formulas.\nHere the copy writer has memorized a list of rules or principles, and tries\nto pour his headline into them like he‚Äôd pour hot lead into a mold. Such\nrules usually concern the way a headline is expressed. ÓÅ¢ey list methods\nof strengthening the verbalization of the headline idea, and here they\nhave a perfectly-valid use. Several examples of these principles are given\nin Chapter 4.\n\nBut the idea for an ad or a headline demands its own shape. It cannot\nbe \u0000tted into someone else‚Äôs solution. ÓÅ¢e problem de\u0000es a formula. And\nthe third, analytical approach that we have outlined above‚Äîwith no\nanswers; only guide-posts and questions‚Äîoffers the only way.\nÓÅ¢is is a hard fact to accept. It means that a solution which has cost\nyou days and weeks of painful effort, and which has done its job perfectly\n‚Äîcan be used only once. It means that there are no creative shortcuts‚Äî\nthat the effort must be duplicated with each individual ad. But fortunately\nthe techniques of probing can be learned and perfected; intuition can be\nsharpened; a sensitivity can be developed for picking out the vital fact\nfrom a maze of information.\nAnd, of course, abandoning this effort leads to a reality which is even\nharsher. Many copy writers grow old, or tired, or afraid. ÓÅ¢ey stop\nsearching for the unique solution in every problem. From this moment\non, they begin to copy instead of create. And most pathetic of all, many\nbegin to copy themselves. ÓÅ¢e more successful the copy writer, the greater\nthe temptation to \u0000nd his new headline in his old \u0000les.\nBut it won‚Äôt work. Copying can be done by any cub. All this process\ndoes is bring talent down to the level of \u0000le-cabinet mediocrity. ÓÅ¢e true\ncopy writer must argue with success‚Äîhe must push on past it every time\nhe faces a new product. In advertising, as well as in science and in art, the\nsolution to the unique lies only in itself.\nOn Motivation Research and Its\nRelation to the Copy Writer\nAs we have repeated throughout this \u0000rst part of the book, the copy\nwriter‚Äôs primary job is to know his market. Many times, he has to know\nmore about that market than the market knows about itself.\nBefore MR (Motivation Research), he did this mostly by personal\ndigging, reading, talking‚Äîand guessing. With MR, he has some pretty\nprofessional guessers working with him. And they have the equipment to\nprove their guesses far more easily and inexpensively than writing a\ncampaign and testing it.\nÓÅ¢e copy writer can use MR in two ways. It can be a tremendous\nsource of information to him. Information about the most powerful\nneeds and desires of his market‚Äîdesires that may be hidden, verbally\nunacceptable, or completely unknown. It shows him the strength of those\n\ndesires‚Äîtheir driÓÇù and momentum‚Äîthe taboos that accompany them,\nand limit their expression. It helps him locate splits in his market‚Äîgauge\ntheir points of difference‚Äîdesign pinpoint appeals for each of them. And\nit feeds back to him early reactions to his own phraseology‚Äîto test his\nown worry-points in the ad‚Äîto enable him to shiÓÇù emphasis‚Äîand even\nto emerge with a completely new idea. All well and good. But a\nmotivation research \u0000nding is not a headline, nor even the central theme\nof an ad, nor will it ever be. Like any other fact, it is a direction. First it\ntells you where not to go, to avoid wasting your time. And then it\nindicates the general area of your solution.\nBut the transformation of those facts into an idea, and the expression\nof that idea in the strongest possible form, still requires as much creative\ntalent as any other starting point. ÓÅ¢e source of an idea, no matter how\nprofound, is still only the beginning. ÓÅ¢e copy writer has to take it from\nthere.\nÓÅ¢e second great service that MR can perform for the copy writer is\nthat of testing his own hunches, in answering the questions he uncovers\nin dealing with his market over a period of time.\nFor purposes of simplicity, we have dealt with advertising strategy as\nthough it always consisted of writing a single ad‚Äîrather than a\ncontinuous campaign. By limiting ourselves in this way, we have been\nable to deal with each of the phases of such a campaign as though it were\na separate and distinct problem, requiring a separate and distinct\nadvertisement to solve it. In doing this, we have emphasized that a\nbreakthrough can occur at any stage of a campaign; and that the same\nbreakthrough techniques can be used to produce the germ idea for the\nentire campaign that follows.\nIn reality, however, the copy writer usually works on a given product,\nor in a given market area, for long periods of time. During that time he\nwill write many ads on this same subject. And during that time he will\nengage in a kind of discourse with his market, in which he feeds that\nmarket ideas, and it feeds back to him reactions to those ideas.\nDuring this massive conversation, if he is sensitive, the copy writer\nwill pick up a continuous \u0000ow of the most vital information. Some of this\ninformation will be actual trends and preferences, which can be\nimmediately translated into new ads. But much more of it will be in\nnegative form‚Äîfailures, roadblocks, limitations to the response from his\nads. And only the statistical measurements of these limitations will be\n\nshown‚Äînot their causes. ÓÅ¢e copywriter will want to know why they\noccur. And in asking why, he will give birth to questions like these:\nWhat causes one woman to make most of her clothes at home, and\nanother woman to use her sewing machine only for minor repairs?\nHow can we convince more people that it‚Äôs safe to buy through mail-\norder?\nWhy will men instantly buy an automatic potato peeler‚Äîand women\nsend it right back to the store again?\nÓÅ¢ese are research questions. ÓÅ¢ey deal with psychological\ndimensions. ÓÅ¢e copy writer discovers them, and passes them along to\nhis MR people to be phrased, tested and answered. ÓÅ¢us is born a new\nidea, a new theme, and a new headline, perhaps even a new campaign.\nOn Expressing the Personality of a Product in\nYour Headline\nOne of the most potent discoveries of motivation research is that a\nproduct, or a store, or a whole group of products has a distinct and\ncomplete personality to the consumer. ÓÅ¢is personality is a complex\nquality, embracing many traits. In the case of the Cadillac, for example, it\nconsists of quality, prestige, performance, appearance, comfort, resale\nvalue, freedom from repairs and much more.\nBut‚Äîand this is the important point to consider in writing your\nheadline‚Äîone of these traits will always be the most effective in\nsummarizing and expressing this personality. In the case of Cadillac, it has\nalways been, and will always be, quality. ÓÅ¢is summary trait is featured in\na series of headlines, or headline illustrations‚Äîperhaps blended with one\nor two of the other traits to give it variety but always strengthening those\nother traits by interrelating them to this one dominant quality.\nÓÅ¢us the personality is simpli\u0000ed, symbolized and sharpened to grasp\nthe reader. And then‚Äîas the reader moves on through the body copy of\nthe ad‚Äîthis personality is expanded and examined in all its appeals‚Äîan\never-enlarging pyramid of persuasion, drawing in all the necessary\ninformation‚Äîcharging that information with desire‚Äîterminating\ninevitably in the one source of satisfaction for that desire‚Äîyour product.\nWe will examine this concept more thoroughly in Chapter 8‚Äîon\nIdenti\u0000cation.\n\nOn the Only Type of Prevention Headline ÓÅ¢at\nWill Sell\nMany copy writers believe that no prevention headline can ever be\neffective, because it treats a problem that may occur and that is not\nactually plaguing your prospect at this moment. ÓÅ¢e reason they give for\nthis failure is the inability of the prospect to identify himself with a\nproblem that has not already forced itself upon him.\nÓÅ¢is is true‚Äîbut only for those problems which affect him personally.\nHe is perfectly capable of imagining such problems afflicting his loved\nones, his friends, his wife and children, even his nation. ÓÅ¢is is why\ndecay-preventing toothpaste sold so well when the ads focused the decay,\nnot on the parent, but on the children. ÓÅ¢is is why life insurance can be\nsold, not by picturing the prospects death, but the horrors in\u0000icted upon\nhis wife and children if insufficient money is leÓÇù over to take care of\nthem.\nTo sum up: A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to\nhimself, but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying\npreventatives from, the image of such future problems affecting others\naround him.\nOn the Selection of Splinter Markets to Avoid\nCompetition\nÓÅ¢roughout this book, we have assumed that each competitor in a\nmarket will try to advertise to that market as a whole. For example, that\nevery reducing aid will try to sell all women that are interested in losing\nweight.\nÓÅ¢is assumption is not necessarily true, in at least two respects. First,\nit assumes that such a market is all of one piece (for example: that all\nwomen want to lose weight for the same reason). ÓÅ¢ey do not, of course.\nÓÅ¢ere are at least two major sub-categories in the market‚Äîthose who\nwant to lose weight for appearance reasons, and those who must lose\nweight because of their health. ÓÅ¢e same general appeal‚ÄîLOSE\nWEIGHT‚Äîwill be effective with both. But certainly the mechanisms\nshould vary‚Äîspeed and ease in the \u0000rst‚Äîsafety and permanence in the\nsecond.\n\nSecondly, a small company with a limited budget may avoid\ncompeting with larger rivals for the core of the market, and may\nconcentrate its attack on a smaller segment of that market. ÓÅ¢is is usually\ndone regionally. But it may be even more effective if it is based on the\nsociology of the market rather than its geography. For example, a\nreducing aid may decide to abandon the greater appearance segment of\nthe market, and appeal much more speci\u0000cally to the health segment.\nÓÅ¢is deliberate focusing of the appeal would alter every aspect of the\ncampaign, from the headline, through identi\u0000cation copy, through\nmechanism and substantiation‚Äîright down to the selection of media and\nchannels of distribution. (Health and geriatric magazines, and\ndistribution through doctors rather than drug stores.)\nEventually, of course, if the appeal is successful and the budget grows,\nthen the advertiser can decide to invade the majority market. If he does\nthis, the success of the initial limited campaign can be used as a point of\ndifference to appeal to the larger market. For example, the fact that\nwomen who were forced to lose weight permanently relied on this\nproduct more than twice as oÓÇùen as any other, etc.\nIn Summary\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst \u0000ve chapters of this book, which you have just \u0000nished,\ndescribe a process which may take days, or weeks, or months to complete.\nÓÅ¢is process begins with a thorough analysis of the market for your\nclient‚Äôs product‚Äîwith an attempt to measure the breadth and depth of\nthat market‚Äîto identify the gigantic emotional forces that create that\nmarket‚Äîto de\u0000ne and focus those forces in terms of a single image or\ndesire or need‚Äîand to channel those forces toward one inevitable\nsolution‚Äîyour client‚Äôs product.\nIn order to do this, the second step of this process involves a\nmeticulous study of the product itself‚Äîwhat it is and what it does‚Äîthe\nphysical product that you will deliver, and the functional product that\nyou will sell‚Äîall its various satisfactions and performances‚Äîagain\nfocused to a single image, a single identi\u0000cation, a single claim that will\ntap the greatest possible emotional force within your market.\nÓÅ¢e combination of these \u0000rst and second steps gives you the theme\nof your ad‚Äîthe desire your market demands and its satisfaction ‚Ä¶ the\n\nneed your market feels and its solution ‚Ä¶ the identi\u0000cation your market\ngropes for and its expression.\nAnd once you discover this theme, you begin the process of\nexpressing it. You explore the state of maturity of your market. You \u0000nd\nout how much people know about your product and what it does‚Äîhow\nmuch they‚Äôve been told about similar products‚Äîand how much they care\nabout both.\nOut of this analysis comes the point of entry for your headline‚Äîthe\npoint of contact‚Äîthe point of greatest interest and acceptance on the part\nof your prospect. It may be located anywhere‚Äîin your product itself, in\nits price, in its performance, in the satisfaction your product promises, in\nthe need your market demands from your product, or only in the market\nitself. But, wherever it is, this is the point where you start. Here the\nsearching and the planning stop. Here the words begin.\nAgain, this process may take weeks or even months. And at the end of\nthat time, you may have written \u0000ve or ten words.\nÓÅ¢ese \u0000ve or ten words will make up about 90% of the value of your\nad. If you are right, they may start a new industry. If you are wrong,\nnothing you write aÓÇùer them will save your ad. Copy writing‚Äîon the\nidea level‚Äîis an all or nothing profession. You build your idea, piece by\npiece ‚Ä¶ you crowd it into \u0000ve or ten words ‚Ä¶ and then it stands or dies\nby itself. And everything that follows it, stands or dies with it. ÓÅ¢is is why\nwe have devoted so much time to this planning process.\nAnd it is a process. You don‚Äôt get an idea or a headline‚Äîyou either\nbuild it, or you unfold it, petal by petal. You dig it out of the market\nresearch ‚Ä¶ you wring it out of the product ‚Ä¶ you read, you listen, you\nexperiment for yourself. You work‚Äîhard. You rub up against this\nproduct and this market so hard that they seep into your pores. And‚Äî\nabove everything else‚Äîyou remember this cardinal ride of creativity:\nWhat you are looking for in this product and this market is the one\nelement that makes them unique. ÓÇªe idea you want‚Äîthe headline you\nwant‚Äîthe breakthrough you want‚Äîare all wrapped up inside that product\nand that market. Nowhere else. And no outside ride‚Äîno outside formula\nwill give them to you. You are facing a product-market-timing relationship\nthat never happened before‚Äîit is unique. And the solution you need is just\nas unique.\nWhat this \u0000rst part of the book has tried to give you is not molds, but\ncompasses. Not formulas to copy word by word, or rules to rigidly follow.\n\nBut rather guide-posts to set your thinking in the right direction.\nSpeci\u0000cally and technically, these guideposts fall into two classes:\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst are analytical procedures. ÓÅ¢eir purpose is to break down a\ncomplicated problem into its parts ‚Ä¶ to examine those parts one by one\n‚Ä¶ to \u0000nd out which is the most important‚Äîand to start your solution\nfrom there.\nOnce you have done this, you then begin to build up your solution to\nits greatest power. You do this by removing limiting factors, and by\nadding everything you can \u0000nd that will strengthen your idea. If we wrote\nliterature instead of advertising, these two processes would be called\nconception and execution. In copy writing, we say that we get the main\ntheme for our ad, and then we put it into a headline.\nAnd when you have \u0000nished, you have \u0000ve or ten words. If they are\nthe right words, they will be immensely valuable. But they still will be\nonly the start. ÓÅ¢ey are the end of one road, and the beginning of another.\nÓÅ¢ey are the invitation to your ad‚Äîthe hand you extend to your prospect\nfor your product. Your job is now to make that introduction worthwhile\n‚Äîfor both parties.\nIn the remainder of the book, we shall discuss the techniques of\nwriting the body copy of your ad. ÓÅ¢ese techniques are directed toward\none end: building conviction‚Äînot only instilling the desire for your\nproduct, but actually strengthening that desire with the belief that that\nproduct will DO what the prospect wants.\nWe now turn to this process of building your ad, so that your ad\nbuilds conviction.\n\nPART II - THE SEVEN BASIC TECHNIQUES\nOF BREAKTHROUGH ADVERTISING\nHOW TO WRITE BODY COPY AS STRONG AS YOUR HEADLINE\n\n1\n-\nINSIDE YOUR PROSPECT‚ÄôS MIND‚ÄîWHAT\nMAKES PEOPLE READ, WANT, BELIEVE\nYou have now built your headline. You now have a means of stopping\nyour prospect‚Äîof bringing to a momentary halt all the diverse activities\nof his mind‚Äîof focusing his attention, at least for a moment, on a single\nthought. ÓÅ¢is is the job that you have designed your headline to do‚Äînot\nto sell, or identify your product, or even mention the need or desire that\nyour product satis\u0000es‚Äîbut simply and solely to \u0000ag down your prospect,\nand get him to read your \u0000rst paragraph.\nFrom that moment on, your body copy does the selling. It does this by\naltering your prospect‚Äôs vision of reality. It creates a new world for your\nprospect‚Äîa world in which your product emerges as the ful\u0000llment of the\ndominant desire that caused this man to respond to your headline.\nTo create this world, your copy must expand or alter one or more of\nthe three dimensions of his already-existing mental world. ÓÅ¢is is the task\nof the remainder of your ad. Your copy must be long enough to\naccomplish this change‚Äîand the length of your ad will depend on three\nfactors:\nFirst, how much copy you need to build his desire for that product‚Äî\nand everything that product can do for him‚Äîto its greatest possible\nstrength.\nSecond, how much additional copy you need to make him feel both\ncomfortable and complimented by that product, to enable him to visualize\nthat product as a part of the life structure that he has built, and is\nbuilding, for himself.\nAnd, \u0000nally, how much additional copy you need to make him believe\nwhat you have said‚Äîto compensate for his already-existing prejudices\nand beliefs.\nÓÅ¢e answers to these three questions determine not only the length of\nyour ad, but also its structure, its development, its style and its pace. Each\nof these questions relates to a separate dimension of your prospect‚Äôs mind\n‚Äîdifferent ways he has of arranging thoughts and feelings. In this\nchapter, we will examine these three dimensions brie\u0000y, and sketch in\nwhat ways, and to what extent, you can alter or expand them through\nyour ad. And then, in the following chapters, we will detail these\nmechanisms of persuasion thoroughly along with the most effective\ntechniques of presenting them.\n\nAnd then, in the last chapter, we will try to weave them together into\na simple, straight-line, logical progression of images ‚Äîleading your\nreader from the headline, through the product, to the actual purchase.\nLet us start with these three dimensions of thought and feeling:\n1. Desires\nÓÅ¢ese are the wants, needs, cravings, thirsts, hungers, lusts, etc. that\ndrive your prospect through life. ÓÅ¢ey are physical‚Äîsuch as the desire to\nbe thin, or strong, or healthy, or free from acne, corns, bad breath or what\nhave you. ÓÅ¢ey are material‚Äîsuch as the desire to possess money, or a big\ncar, or a beautiful dress. ÓÅ¢ey are sensual‚Äîsuch as the thirst for a cold\nglass of beer, or the need for a tired body to stretch out on a soÓÇù bed.\nÓÅ¢ey have, of course, tremendous driving power. And they already\nexist. You cannot create them, diminish them, or battle them. But you can\nexpand them, sharpen them, channel them, and give them a goal. And this\nis your primary task as a copy writer.\nYour \u0000rst task‚Äîand in some ads your only task‚Äîis to make your\nprospect want. To sharpen his desire. To picture every moment of its\nful\u0000llment. To let him see it, feel it, touch it, sit in it, listen to his friends\nrave about it. To make him visualize the wonderful new world your\nproduct offers him so strongly that he practically lives in it‚Äîand then to\noffer him that product. ÓÅ¢e method of doing this‚ÄîIntensi\u0000cation‚Äîwill\nbe discussed in the next chapter.\n2. Identi\u0000cations\nÓÅ¢ese are the roles your prospect wants to play in life, and the\npersonality traits he wants your product to help him build, or project.\nÓÅ¢ese longings for identi\u0000cation‚Äîlongings for a sharply-de\u0000ned\npersonality‚Äîlongings for social status‚Äîare, of course, not material or\nphysical or sensual at all. ÓÅ¢ey complement and intensify the physical\ndesires‚Äîadd another dimension to them‚Äîby making each purchase\nserve a double duty. ÓÅ¢us, not only does a woman buy a low-calorie food\nto become thin, but in so doing she also builds again a radiant, attractive,\nyouthful personality. And not only does a man buy a car for the power,\nspeed and transportation it will give him, but equally as much for the\n\nprojection of prestige, success and ready-cash-to-burn that this purchase\ncommunicates to his neighbors.\nCall them what you will‚Äîgoals, hopes, dreams, ambitions, envies,\nadmirations, fantasies or objectives‚Äîthese subtle, symbolic, never-\nopenly-spoken projections of our own self-images are immensely\npowerful sales forces. Your task is to put them directly behind your\nproduct. To make him feel the prestigious and select group he joins when\nhe becomes a user of that product. To picture for him the people who live\nin your product‚Äôs world today.\n3. Beliefs\nÓÅ¢ese are the opinions, attitudes, prejudices, fragments of knowledge\nand conceptions of reality that your prospect lives by. ÓÅ¢is is the world of\nemotionalized reason that he inhabits‚Äîthe way he accepts or rejects facts\nand builds up his universe, the types of thinking he uses to arrive at\ndecisions, the ideas and values which give him comfort and which he\nbelieves are permanent and true.\nÓÅ¢ese ideas may be shallow or profound, valid or false, perfectly\nlogical or mere wishful thinking. But it is not advertising‚Äôs mission to\nargue with them. And no one advertiser can change them. Advertising is\nnot education; it does not have society as its sponsor, nor does it have the\nyears of time that are given to education to produce results.\nAdvertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists, not as it\nmight wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality‚Äînot by smashing into\nit head-on‚Äîbut by exploiting its tendencies and giving direction to its\nenergies.\nBelieving is a process‚Äîa process of \u0000tting new facts into certain\nestablished patterns of thought and conviction. People believe in certain\nways. ÓÅ¢ese beliefs form a \u0000lter through which your product-information\nmust pass or be rejected. And their already-established patterns of\nreasoning create habit-channels along which your copy must build its\nconviction‚Äîor die.\nYou start with these beliefs as a base. You build up from them by\nusing his kind of logic, not your own, to prove that your product satis\u0000es\nhis desires‚Äîto prove that your product works‚Äîto prove that his kind of\npeople rely on your product‚Äîto prove that no other product satis\u0000es his\nneeds as well.\n\nÓÅ¢e mechanisms for doing this are shown in Chapters 9 and 10.\nÓÅ¢ere you have them. Desires‚Ä¶ Identi\u0000cations‚Ä¶ Beliefs. Each of\nthem composed of equal parts of emotion and thought. ÓÅ¢e three\ndimensions of your prospect‚Äôs mind‚Äîthe raw materials with which you\nwill work.\nTo study them, we shall deal with each of them separately. But, in\nactually writing your ad, of course, you will weave them into each other‚Äî\nto create a simple, \u0000uid path of thought from the beginning to the end of\nyour ad. ÓÅ¢is technique‚ÄîBlending and Reinforcement‚Äîwill be the\nsubject of Chapter 14.\n\n2\n-\nTHE FIRST TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY:\nINTENSIFICATION\nÓÅ¢irteen Ways to Strengthen Desire\nÓÅ¢e force that creates sales, that powers our present economy, is\ndesire. Mass Desire, spread among millions of men and women. And the\nart of salesmanship, fundamentally and primarily, is expanding this\ndesire. Expanding it horizontally, among more and more people.\nExpanding it vertically by sharpening and magnifying it‚Äîby building it\nto such a pitch that it overcomes the obstacles of skepticism, lethargy and\nprice, and results in the sale.\nAdvertising is salesmanship in print. ÓÅ¢erefore, above everything else,\nadvertising is the literature of desire. It is society‚Äôs encyclopedia of dreams\n‚Ä¶ our twentieth-century Wish Book. Advertising gives form and content\nto desire. It provides it with a goal. ÓÅ¢ese desires, as they exist in the mind\nof your prospect today, are indistinct. ÓÅ¢ey are blurs‚Äîhazy, ambiguous,\nnot yet crystallized into words or images. In most cases, they are simply\nvague emotions, without compulsion or direction. And as such, they have\nonly a fraction of their true potential power.\nYour job is to \u0000ll out these vague desires with concrete images‚Äîto show\nyour prospect every possible way that they can be ful\u0000lled‚Äîto multiply their\nstrength by the number of satisfactions that you can suggest to achieve\nthem.\nA copy writer‚Äôs \u0000rst quali\u0000cations are imagination and enthusiasm.\nYou are literally the script writer for your prospect‚Äôs dreams. You are the\nchronicler of his future. Your job is to show him in minute detail all the\ntomorrows that your product makes possible for him.\nÓÅ¢is is the core of advertising‚Äîits fundamental function. To take\nunformulated desire, and translate it into one vivid scene of ful\u0000llment\naÓÇùer another. To add the appeal of concrete satisfaction aÓÇùer satisfaction\nto the basic drive of that desire. To make sure that your prospect realizes\neverything that he is getting‚Äîeverything that he is now leaving behind\nhim‚Äîeverything that he may possibly be missing.\nÓÅ¢e sharper you can draw your pictures‚Äîand the greater the number\nof them that you can legitimately present‚Äîthe more your prospect will\n\ndemand your product, and the less important will seem your price.\nHow much space can you give to this process of Intensi\u0000cation? ÓÅ¢is\ndepends on two factors‚Äîthe amount of space allotted to you for the\nentire ad, and the number of ways you can present your images without\ngiving the feeling of repetition or boredom.\nFirst of all, different media demand different treatments. For example,\ncatalogs, small-space newspaper and magazine advertising, radio and\ntelevision strictly limit the number of words given to you to draw your\nimages. To \u0000t your message into their structures, you must use either or\nboth of two techniques. ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is compression‚Äîthe boiling down of\nprojections and images into a few key words. And the second is the\ncampaign‚Äîthe repetition of these key words over and over again‚Äîalong\nwith a progression of embellishments and differentiations‚Äîthrough an\nentire series of advertisements.\nWe shall see how this is done, in detail, at the end of this chapter.\nOn the other hand, large-space newspaper and magazine advertising\nand especially direct mail give you adequate room, in most cases, to\npresent a full story in these media, the decision as to length depends far\nmore on the second factor‚Äîthe number of ways you can present your\nimages without giving the feeling of repetition or boredom.\nNo matter what you do, your prospect will take with him only one\nbasic idea, one dominant image from your ad. But with every additional\nnew and different way that you can present that idea, it becomes sharper\nand more real in your prospect‚Äôs mind, and it builds up more and more\nemotional weight.\nÓÅ¢us the problem becomes one of perspective, of fresh viewpoints, of\nnew and different detail. Of walking around your product in your\nimagination, and presenting it to your prospect in every way in which it\nenters his life.\nYou are working against two opposing forces. ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst, as in your\nheadline, is the amount of material which has already been presented to\nyour prospect about similar products in other ads. ÓÅ¢ere are stages of\nmarket sophistication to be dealt with in body copy as well as in your\nheadline. If your prospect has read the same phraseology before, he will\nbe bored by it, no matter where he encounters it again.\nAnd the second obstacle is the phraseology of your own ad. Once you\nhave presented your basic ful\u0000llment in a certain way; then you must vary\n\nyour viewpoint in your second description, or not present it again.\nOtherwise you will lose your reader in the middle of your ad.\nYou cannot repeat, but you can reinforce. And every time the same\nbasic promise is given a fresh setting for your prospect, it reinforces the\ndescriptions that went before it, and makes your prospect that much\nmore determined to participate.\nÓÅ¢e presenting of a series of fresh, new and different ful\u0000llments for\nyour prospects dominant desire‚Äîour \u0000rst mechanism of persuasion‚Äîis\ncalled Intensi\u0000cation. It takes many forms, with many more certainly to\nbe invented. We will list some of them here, giving the complete copy\nexamples to show how they have been worked out to deal with speci\u0000c\ncopy problems.\nOur illustrations in this part of the book will be drawn mostly from\nmail order. ÓÅ¢e reason for this is simple. Mail order advertising must\naccomplish its sale from a single ad, without relying on the cumulative\nforce of the campaign, and without help from product display or\nsalespeople. ÓÅ¢erefore, mail order tries to present as much of the\ncomplete story as possible at one time. ÓÅ¢ese same techniques apply\nequally well to all forms of advertising. But there they are usually quite\ncompressed, and their purpose and structure was not quite so apparent.\nHere are these techniques of Intensi\u0000cation:\nYour First Presentation of Your Claims\n1. First present the product or the satisfaction it gives directly‚Äîbluntly\n‚Äîby a thorough, completely detailed description of its appearance or the\nresults it gives. For example, this rose ad:\nMORE ROSES THAN YOU EVER SAW ON\nANY ROSE BUSH‚Ä¶\nLeading Eastern Agricultural College reports: This\nfabulous rose variety produced 500 blooms in June ‚Ä¶ 1523\nmore blooms in July‚Ä¶ 1616 more blooms in August‚Ä¶ 437\nmore blooms in September ‚Ä¶ 4,076 roses all from one\nsingle plant‚Ä¶\nCan you imagine the fantastic beauty of a rosebush\nthat can easily give you MORE THAN 4,000 ROSES from\n\nJune to September‚Äîand then keeps on blooming heavily\nright up into frost‚Ä¶\nCan you imagine the fantastic thrill of walking into\nyour garden and actually picking 3 dozen, even 4 dozen\nroses a day from a single plant, day after day, week after\nweek‚Äîand still leave gigantic clusters of bloom on each\nsingle plant.\nColorful, fragrant roses almost as large as the most\nexpensive Hybrid Teas, yet blooming by the hundreds at\none single time ‚Ä¶ on one single bush! Cherry-pink 3-inch\nroses overlaid with tinges of red that deepen in fire and\nbrilliance as the blossoms unfold‚Äîto reveal a dazzling\ngold splash on their petals! Roses that burst into living\nwalls of blossoms that flame again and again into\nexquisite masses of bloom in June, July, August,\nSeptember, October, November ‚Ä¶ and often stay in\nbloom weeks after the first snows have fallen! ‚Ä¶\nThis is the rose with such fantastic blooming power\nthat it will actually give you huge clusters of 10, 12 even 15\nflowers on a single stem ‚Ä¶ and produce those clusters in\nsolid masses of bloom! Clusters as large as both of your\noutstretched hands put together ‚Ä¶ clusters that actually\nmeasure up to one full foot across ‚Ä¶ each stem a\ncomplete floral bouquet in itself‚Ä¶ that gives you an\naverage of more than 50 NEW ROSES day after day, week\nafter week, for 8, 9 even 10 weeks in a row during the hot\n‚Äúdog days‚Äù of summer‚Ä¶ Enough roses to fill every room in\nyour house with color and fragrance all summer long ‚Ä¶\nEnough roses to drench your terrace with beauty, to\nsweep around your home and flood your beds, your\nborders, your walks, your driveway with solid, living walls\nof roses all summer long ‚Ä¶ with just a few plants!\nAnd this is the rose you can have blooming in your\ngarden now and for years to come, that will make your\ngrounds the garden showplace of the neighborhood, if you\naccept this extraordinary flower offer now! ‚Ä¶\nOr, as another example, this description of the results of a Christmas\n\u0000ashlight projector that shows colored slides of the Bible:\n\n‚Ä¶ You take out the amazing invention we send you.\nYou simply switch it on. And suddenly every person in the\nroom draws in his breath in excitement and admiration!\nFor there before you on that living room wall‚Äî\nprojected four feet wide by three feet tall‚Äîis one of the\nmost beautiful pictures you have ever seen! Before your\neyes‚Äîso real that you can practically reach out and touch\nher‚Äîis the Virgin Mary holding the Infant Jesus in her\narms. The picture actually glows with exquisite color. You\ncan see every magnificent detail ‚Ä¶ the animals huddled\naround the manger ‚Ä¶ the tenderness in the Virgins eyes ‚Ä¶\nthe smile on the Infant‚Äôs face.\nIt‚Äôs almost as though you were actually there!\nSuddenly all the wonderful tales your children have heard\n‚Ä¶ all the meaning and glory of Christmas ‚Ä¶ come alive\nbefore your children‚Äôs eyes! Life-sized ‚Ä¶ as tall as your\nchildren ‚Ä¶ scene after scene parades before them on their\nliving room wall! They actually see the Angel of God\nannouncing the Birth to the Shepherds! They witness the\nStar of Bethlehem rising over the world! They stand side\nby side with the Three Wise men in silent adoration!\nBefore their very eyes, they see Christ grow to\nmaturity. They watch him astound the elders of the\nTemple as a small child. They thrill to his first meeting with\nJohn the Baptist. They are present at the Sermon on the\nMount. They witness each of the miracles‚Äîsee with their\nown eyes Jesus calming the storm ‚Ä¶ teaching Peter to\nwalk on the water ‚Ä¶ raising Lazarus from the dead.\nCan there be any more thrilling experience? Suddenly\nevery sermon they have ever heard ‚Ä¶ every book they\nhave ever read ‚Ä¶ every prayer they have ever learned,\ntakes on new meaning and beauty for them. This is\nprobably the most thrilling hour you will ever spend with\nyour children. They will ask you to repeat it time and time\nagain. These magnificent pictures will continue to thrill\nand astound and instruct them for years to come ‚Ä¶\nOr, as another example, this description of the outward appearance of\na giant \u0000ying plastic model jet:\n\n‚Ä¶ Yes! Just imagine the expression on your children‚Äôs\nfaces, when they walk into your living room just one week\nfrom today, and suddenly see this magnificent model\nairplane standing in front of them on the living room table!\nHere is a gigantic, three-dimensional, all plastic model\nairplane‚Äîresting securely on its own triple landing gear‚Äî\nand so huge that its tail section alone stands six full inches\nfrom the table!\nThis magnificent model airplane proudly bears the\nofficial colors of Pan American Airways! Its wings and\nengines are a dazzling silver! Its fuselage is a gleaming\nwhite‚Äîwith a brilliant blue stripe stretching back twenty-\none inches along the entire length of the body! And\nstamped on both sides of the huge rudder is the Fan\nAmerican World Globe‚Äîand the American flag above it,\nready to identify this plane anywhere she goes!\nBoth the wings and the tail section are slanted\ndiagonally back‚Äîready to cut through the air at 600 scale\nmiles an hour! And suspended beneath the wings are the\nfour huge engines‚Äîeach as long and as thick as your\nchild‚Äôs fingers‚Äîeach with its own JET SOUND\nSIMULATOR, to give your child thrill after thrill after thrill\nWHEN HE ACTUALLY FLIES THIS BREATH-TAKING\nMODEL HIMSELF! .\nPut the Claims in Action\n2. Now that you have presented your main description, you are ready to\nexpand the image. One of the most effective ways to do this is to PUT THE\nPRODUCT IN ACTION for your reader. To show, not only how the product\nlooks, and what bene\u0000ts it gives the reader, hut exactly how it does this. As\none example, let‚Äôs continue with our model jet airplane ad:\nNo Fuel! No Danger! No Crack-Ups! Yet It Flies 600\nScale Miles An Hour, All Under Your Complete Control!\nPick this magnificent plastic model up from the table\nand hand it to your child. While he holds it, simply attach\nthe U-Control Line as we show you to the left wing. Then\n\nsuspend the model from this control line, and begin slowly\nto swing it through the air. Before your astonished eyes,\nyou will see one of the most thrilling sights of your entire\nlife!\nThis model is perfectly designed for high-speed flight!\nAs soon as it picks up power from the motion of your\nhand, it will lift up its nose, its wings will begin to cut\nthrough the air, it will flash upward and streak ahead of\nyou! As you give it more and more line, it will turn wider\nand wider, fly faster and faster ‚Ä¶ You can fly it in circles\nonly five feet wide, or you can take it outdoors and fly it in\ngigantic arcs one hundred feet wide‚Äîthe size of an entire\ncity lot ‚Ä¶\nYou can make this plane soar upward‚Äîstall at fantastic\nheights‚Äîdive toward the ground‚Äîand then pick up speed\nand flash upward again in a breath-taking rescue! ‚Ä¶ You\ncan spiral this magnificent model down into a perfect\nlanding! You can fly two or more planes in formation! You\ncan have jet races! You can have an entire fleet of\nbreathtaking models flown by every member of your\nfamily‚Äîand you can have them for only $1 apiece‚Äîless\nthan ONE-FIFTH the price you‚Äôd pay for a plastic model of\nthis size and performance! ‚Ä¶\nOr, as another example, this product-in-action description from a\nbrochure selling a self-propelled \u0000sh lure:\n‚Ä¶ Think of it! To fuel up this amazing, live-action lure,\nall you do is this. Simply snap open the fuel chamber‚Äî\npour in the absolutely harmless fuel‚Äîand close the fuel\nchamber again! ‚Ä¶ Simply cast or lower that power-packed\nlure into fresh or salt water‚Äîand get set for the fishing\nthrill of your life!\nFor perhaps one minute, the lure will float quietly on\nthe surface of the water. But then that water will reach the\nfuel charge inside‚Äîthe lure will seem to shudder for a\nsecond‚Äîand then it will spring dramatically to ‚Äúlife‚Äù!\nThe air around it will be filled with the buzzing sound\nof a dying bee! Instantly, the nose of the lure will point\n\ndownward, and it will begin its first descent! Slowly,\njerkily, like a maimed minnow, it will swim noisily\ndownward‚Äîbuzzing and humming‚Äîtraveling about nine\nfeet every fifteen seconds! If no fish intercepts it, it will\nthen automatically stop its descent‚Äîslowly raise up its\nnose‚Äîand begin its irresistible climb to the surface again!\nAnd again! And again! Tirelessly‚Äîhour after hour‚Äî\nlengthening out the reach of your own casts! Roaming\nrestlessly over every foot of water beneath you‚Äîeven on a\nslack line‚Äîeven when your boat is tied up‚Äîeven when\nyou‚Äôre curled up on the dock, sound asleep! ‚Ä¶\nAnd driving the fish around you into such a frenzy with\nits swimming and its buzzing that they practically tear the\nrod out of your hands‚Äîthey‚Äôre so anxious to get their\nmouths into the hook! ‚Ä¶\nBring In the Reader\n3. Or, if your product lends itself to this kind of treatment, put your\nreader right smack in the middle of this product-in-action story, and give\nhim a verbal demonstration of what will happen to him the \u0000rst day he\nowns that product. For example, this passage from an ad selling a power\nbooster for the average car:\n‚Ä¶ Picture this to yourself! Next weekend you go down\nto your car‚Äîthe same tired car that you‚Äôve been driving\nfor years. You‚Äôve made only one simple change to that car,\nso easy that your sixteen year old son could do it. But now,\nwhen you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of\nengineering science comes to life under your hood!\nFrom the very first moment, you‚Äôll see and feel the\ndifference in that engine! ‚Ä¶ When you release the\nemergency brake, your car will glide out of its parking\nspace‚Äîroll down the street with your foot hardly touching\nthe gas pedal. Every 30 or 40 seconds, you‚Äôll give that car\nan extra shot of gas‚Äîfeeling it spurt ahead‚Äîtesting the\nnew power that‚Äôs singing underneath your foot!\n\nWe ask you to pull up to another car at the stop light,\nof approximately the same year and make as your own!\nWait until the light changes from red to green. Let the\nother car start first. Wait till the other car gets half way\nacross the street. And then slam your foot down on the\ngas pedal!\nBefore that other car has even crossed the street, you\nwill have caught up with him. For one brief second, you\nand that other car will race fender to fender. And then you\nwill flash away from him ‚Ä¶ you will leave him a full block\nbehind ‚Ä¶ you will look in your rear view mirror and see the\nstartled look of amazement on the other drivers face! ‚Ä¶\nShow Him How to Test Your Claims\n4. But there is still more room to expand the image along these lines.\nTurn the demonstration into a test. Let your reader visualize himself\nproving the performance of your product‚Äîgaining its bene\u0000ts immediately\n‚Äîin the most speci\u0000c and dramatic way possible. For example, in this ad,\nselling a new kind of spark plug:\n‚Ä¶ when you get your set of SA FIRE INJECTORS, here\nis all you do. If you have an automatic transmission, make\na note of how fast your car crawls forward when it is in the\ndrive position, with the motor idling. If you have a sports\ncar, a racing car or boat, make a note of the RPM‚Äôs as\nindicated on the tachometer when the engine is idling. If\nyou have regular transmission, put your car in low gear on\na level road and notice its speed with the motor idling.\nNext ‚Ä¶ screw your injectors right into the spark plug\nopenings ‚Ä¶\nNow, if you have an automatic transmission‚Äîput your\ncar in drive and let your engine idle. If your car stood still\nwith spark plugs, it will now move forward at from 4 to 6\nmiles an hour; that means that the amount of gas that just\nkept your engine turning over will now carry you up to 6\nmiles at no cost to you.\n\nIf you have a racing or sports car or a boat with a\ntachometer, your RPM‚Äôs will increase up to 200 more at\nidling and up to 300 more at high speeds.\nIf you have regular transmission, in low gear with your\nmotor idling your car will move forward 4 to 6 miles per\nhour faster. In other words, no matter what you drive, here\nis absolute proof that you can go further, faster and\ncheaper‚Ä¶\nOr, as another example, this demonstration-test from an ad selling a\nmemory course, with the headline, ‚ÄúGive Me One Evening and I‚Äôll Give\nyou a Push-Button Memory‚Äù:\n‚Ä¶ Take this book and turn to page 39. Read eight short\npages‚Äîno more. And then, put down the book. Review in\nyour own mind the one simple secret I‚Äôve shown you. And\nthen‚Äîget ready to test your new AUTOMATIC memory!\nWhat you are going to do, in that very first evening, is\nthis. Without referring to the book, you are going to sit\ndown, and you are going to write‚Äînot five, not ten, but\nTWENTY important facts that you have never been able to\nmemorize before! If you are a business man, they may be\ncustomers‚Äô orders that you have received ‚Ä¶ if you are a\nsalesman, they may be twenty different products in your\nline ‚Ä¶ if you are a housewife, they‚Ä¶\nIn any case, you are simply going to glance over that\nlist again for a few moments. You are going to perform a\nsimple mental trick on each one of these facts‚Äîthat will\nburn that fact into your mind, permanently and\nautomatically! And then you are going to put that list\naway ‚Ä¶\nAnd the next morning, you are going to amaze your\nfriends and family! When you go down to business, you\nwill attend to every one of those orders‚Äîautomatically‚Äî\nwithout referring to your memo pad!‚Ä¶\nYes! And you‚Äôll amaze your friends by remembering\nevery product in your line‚Äîbackwards and forwards‚Äîin\nthe exact order that you memorized them! You‚Äôll keep\nevery single appointment on time‚Äîbecause one\n\nappointment will automatically flash into your mind after\nanother‚Äîat the precise moment you need them‚Äîexactly\nas though you pushed a mental button!\nAll this‚Äîin a single evening!‚Ä¶\nStretch Out Your Bene\u0000ts in Time\n5. ÓÅ¢e number of variations, of fresh, startling viewpoints is endless.\nHere is another departure from the product-in-action theme: showing\nthe product at work, not for just an hour or a day, but over a span of\nweeks and months. Here you extend your reader‚Äôs vision further and\nfurther into time‚Äîshowing him a continuous \u0000ow of bene\u0000ts. ÓÅ¢is\npassage is taken from an ad for an English plant food:\n‚Ä¶ First, the amazing English pellets give your plants a\ntremendous new burst of growth! New plants and old‚Äî\nthey send out dozens of hidden shoots and buds! Some of\nyour plants may actually DOUBLE in height and breadth\nthe very first month!\nBut this is just the beginning! Within one or two short\nweeks‚Äîwithout you even touching your plant‚Äîthis\namazing pellet AUTOMATICALLY begins the second stage\nof its work! It automatically sends out a second wonder-\nworking nutrient‚Äîthat enters into every cell of your\nplants‚Äô bodies‚Äîthat fills those cells with health and\nstrength and sturdiness ‚Ä¶ Great, tall stems stand up with\nmilitary precision! Giant buds begin to swell with vigor and\nvitality! Even tired old shrubs and trees‚Äîthat you had\nalmost given up for lost‚Äîbegin to straighten out‚Äîfatten\nup‚Äîsend out the young green growth that you had never\nhoped to see again!\nAnd then, the most remarkable part of all! Just as\nthese fantastically beautiful plants have reached their full,\nglorious height and strength‚Äîat that moment these tiny\nEnglish pellets automatically liberate still a third wonder-\nworking ingredient!‚Ä¶ .\nAnd when that third precious ingredient reaches those\nbuds‚Äîthen that very morning you will open the door to\n\nyour house‚ÄîAND YOU WILL BE BLINDED BY THE\nEXPLOSION OF COLOR THAT GREETS YOU IN YOUR\nGARDEN! ‚Ä¶ You will see rose bushes weighted down with\nmasses of blossoms, of a richness and perfume and color\nyou have never imagined before! You will see dahlias and\nasters and gladiolas so massive, so exquisite, so\nbreathtakingly beautiful that you can hardly believe that\nthey are the same plants that you put in the ground! And\nwhen your neighbors begin to pour into your yard‚Äîwhen\nyou watch them bend and touch these flowers to see if\nthey are real‚ÄîTHEN YOU WILL KNOW A FEELING OF\nGARDEN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND PRIDE THAT YOU\nNEVER DREAMED OF BEFORE!‚Ä¶\nBring In an Audience\n6. At the end of this passage, other actors besides the reader are brought\ninto the scene. Each one of them‚Äîeach group of them‚Äîprovides a fresh\nnew perspective through which your reader can view the product. Seen\nthrough their eyes‚Äîexperienced through their actions and reactions‚Äîthe\nproduct performances become new, vivid and completely different again.\nÓÅ¢ese new participants may be celebrities, who relate their\nexperiences through the testimonial. ÓÅ¢is technique is too familiar to\nwarrant an example here. Or they may be average men and women,\nwhom the reader easily identi\u0000es with, whose experiences are related\nthrough narration or the case history. Probably the most famous example\nof a narration is the ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ey Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano‚Äù ad\nquoted in the \u0000rst section of this book. Here, as an example of the case-\nhistory approach, we use a passage from a reducing ad:\n‚Ä¶ And then, if you were like the men and women\nwhose fantastic case histories were reported by leading\nmedical journals, perhaps you went to your doctor and\nasked him for AN EASY WAY OUT‚ÄîWITHOUT TORTURE\n‚ÄîAND WITHOUT SLIDING BACK! ‚Ä¶\nThese doctors had the answer in a tiny grey pill‚Äîand a\ncommon-sense plan ‚Ä¶\n\nThey instructed dozens of patients to test this miracle\nplan in their own homes, under these doctors‚Äô supervision.\nThese men and women did NOT give up the foods they\nloved‚Äîthey simply and naturally cut down on them!\nThey were not given any starvation diets ‚Ä¶ they\nreported, in case after case, that they felt more pep, more\nenergy, more youth and vitality than they had known for\nyears!\nAnd then, day by day, faster and easier and safer than\nthey had ever known before, the ugly excess fat around\ntheir bodies melted away! While they were eating three\ndelicious meals a day, they were shedding as much as five\npounds a week! While they were feasting on mouth-\nwatering steaks, thick juicy slices of roast beef, potatoes,\nbutter and bread‚Äîthey were losing inch after inch after\ninch from around their waistlines, their thighs, their hips.\nClothes that they had discarded years before began to\ncome out of the closets and attics. Men and women both\n‚Äîthey beam to notice a new young look to their chins and\nfaces that they‚Äôd thought they‚Äôd lost forever.\nAnd when the plan was over ‚Ä¶ these men and women\nhad lost as much as 17 and 25 and even 34 pounds ‚Ä¶ they\nhad turned back their weight clock 5, 10 and even 15 years\n‚Ä¶ And their trim, slim figures were just beginning‚Ä¶\nShow Experts Approving\n7.

Experts in the \u0000eld‚Äîprofessionals‚Äîthe sophisticated,\nthe discriminating, the blas√© can be called on to register their reactions.\nÓÅ¢ere is nothing so astounding as the astonishment of experts. Here the\nelements of surprise, competition and discovery all combine to sharpen\nthe image even more. ÓÅ¢is example is taken from the rose ad mentioned\nabove:\n‚Ä¶ Just picture the scene as these college horticulturists\nbegan this amazing flowering test of roses. For here\ngathered in a test field were all the high-praised queens of\n\nrosedom ‚Ä¶ floribundas, hybrid teas, polyanthas, patented\nroses and rose blends that today sell for as high as $3.75\nfor a single plant. Row upon row of roses ‚Ä¶ prize-winners\nin international competition ‚Ä¶ the best the world has to\noffer‚Ä¶ AND THEN, NEARLY WILD STARTED TO BLOOM!\nJust picture the astonishment on these experts‚Äô faces\nwhen in the first month alone, Nearly Wild produced over\n15 times more blossoms than the average of all other\nroses combined; how in July alone it produces an average\nof 50 new roses a day, more than 7 times as many\nblossoms as the second leading rose! How in August it\nproduced 21 times more roses than its nearest competitor;\nand then\nIs it any wonder that a famous rose expert upon\nviewing the results of this test, exclaimed: ‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs like\nhaving a complete rose garden of 20 plants‚Äîall on a single\nbush!‚Äù Or why another rose expert, shaking his head in\ndisbelief, stated: ‚ÄúIf we ever released these flowering\nfigures to the public, they‚Äôd never believe it. And if they did\nbelieve it, we couldn‚Äôt produce Nearly Wild rose plants to\nfill the demand in the next 25 years!‚Äù‚Ä¶ .\nCompare, Contrast, Prove Superiority\n8. Each new approach suggests others. ÓÇªe competition can be carried\ninto contrast. ÓÇªe disadvantages of the old product or service can he laid\nside by side with the advantages of the new‚Äîthrowing these advantages\ninto sharp relief. Here, as one example, is a brief, three-sentence passage\nfrom a book-club radio commercial that establishes the difference\nbetween random buying and book-club savings indelibly on the listener‚Äôs\nmind:\n‚Ä¶ Yes! While your friends were paying $3.95 for their\ncopies of Frank Yerby‚Äôs run-away best seller, The Golden\nHawk, Dollar Book Club members were getting the same\nexact book for only 99c.\nWhile your friends were paying $4.95 for John O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs\nflaming new thriller, A Rage to Live, Dollar Book Club\n\nmembers were getting the same exact book for only 99c.\nAnd while your friends were paying $5.95 for Thomas\nB. Costain‚Äôs towering new triumph, High Flyers, Dollar\nBook Club members were enjoying exactly the same book\n‚Äîfor only 99c!\nOr, as another example, here is a passage from a direct mail piece\nselling a Fuel Reclaimer‚Äîa device for the engine of your car that feeds\nescaping crankcase gases back into your carburetor:\n‚Ä¶ This device uses the suction-power of your own\nmotor to scoop up that smoke. And then‚Äîin one of the\nmost brilliant ideas in engineering history‚Äîit destroys that\nsmoke by feeding it back into your engine, where it is\nburned up again as a continuous, extra flow of fuel!\nThink of it! Instead of polluted oil, polluted engine,\npolluted air‚Äîyou get a constant stream of extra gasoline\nflowing into your engine, almost as though you had a free,\nsecond gas tank connected to your car!\nInstead of one breakdown after another, one more\nrepair bill after another, each more expensive than before,\nyou get young-car power, young-car economy, young-car\nresistance to repair bills, because the deadly sludge-\ncausers, acid-causers, filth-causers that used to ruin your\ncar, are now being burned up as fuel in your engine!‚Ä¶\nPicture the Black Side, Too\n9. And there‚Äôs no need to neglect the Heaven-Or-Hell approach. Here the\nnegative aspect to every promise‚Äîthe problem that you are liberating your\nprospect from forever‚Äîis painted in all its full black color. You irritate the\nwound, and then you apply the salve that heals it.\nÓÅ¢us you derive two currents of motivation‚Äîrepulsion away from the\nformer problem or inadequate product, and the attraction generated by\nyour own product‚Äôs contrasting solutions.\nÓÅ¢ere are several forms in which you can present this before-and-\naÓÇùer picture. You can do it through narration or the testimonial. You can\ndo it by using the ‚Äúpitch‚Äù technique of product ridicule. Or you can\nsimply present straight description of the old product or problem, with all\n\nits detailed drawbacks, and then follow it directly with a similar\ndescription of your new solution in a perfectly parallel style, item by item.\nHere, as an example, is a passage from an ad selling a new kind of spark\nplug:\n‚Ä¶ Someday, if you ever have a spare moment, lift one\nof the old-fashioned spark plugs out of your car! Look at\nthe bottom of that plug. In 10 seconds, you‚Äôll learn more\nabout gas waste than any book could teach you in a year!\nIf that plug has been in your car three thousand miles\nor more, then what you‚Äôll see on the bottom of that plug is\nFILTH! The Firing Point of that plug‚Äîthe most important\nsingle point in your car‚Äîwill be choked, strangled and\nfouled with BLACK, FILTHY CARBON! Carbon that robs\nyour car of as much as 20 vital horsepower every time your\nengine fires!\nNow, wipe that filth away and look at the Firing Point\nitself. This is the POWER POINT of your car ‚Ä¶ the pin-\nhead of electricity that turns raw gas into 300 horsepower\nof driving energy! And what is the condition of that point?\nCORRODED‚ÄîPITTED‚ÄîSCARRED‚ÄîAND WORN! Hardly\nable to deliver half the spark that it should!

Nor do you have to be satis\u0000ed merely with the statement of raw\nfact. ÓÇªere are in\u0000nite opportunities for the use of imagination to present\nthose facts in more dramatic form, outside of the rigidly realistic approach.\nSome of the more famous examples are the Alexander Hamilton ad of the\nTwenties, ‚ÄúThe Glory of the Upward Path.‚Äù Or the Big Ben alarm clock\nseries, ‚ÄúFirst he whispers, then he shouts.‚Äù Or this passage from perhaps\nthe most long-lived ad of them all, the Sherwin Cody English Course, in\nwhich a manual of instruction is personi\u0000ed and given actual life:\nThe basic principle of Mr. Cody‚Äôs new method is habit-\nforming. Anyone can learn to write and speak correctly by\nconstantly using the correct forms. But how is one to\nknow in each case which is correct? Mr. Cody solves this\nproblem in a simple, unique, sensible way.\n100% Self-Correcting Device.\nSuppose he himself were standing forever at your\nelbow. Every time you mispronounced or misspelled a\nword, every time you violated correct grammatical usage,\nevery time you used the wrong word to express what you\nmeant, suppose you could hear him whisper. ‚ÄúThat is\nwrong, it should be thus and so.‚Äù In a short time you would\nhabitually use the correct form and the right words in\nspeaking and writing.\nIf you continued to make the same mistakes over and\nover again, each time patiently he would tell you what was\nright. He would, as it were, be an everlasting mentor\nbeside you‚Äîa mentor who would not laugh at you, but\nwho would, on the contrary, support and help you. This\n100% Self-Correcting Device does exactly this thing. It is\nMr. Cody‚Äôs silent voice behind you, ready to speak out\nwhenever you commit an error. It finds your mistakes and\n\nconcentrates on them. You do not need to study anything\nyou already know. There are no rules to memorize‚Ä¶\nBefore You‚Äôre Done, Summarize\n12. To repeat again, there is an in\u0000nite number of new approaches.\nNo list of them can ever be complete, because new applications, new\nperspectives, new viewpoints are being discovered every day.\nWhich of them, and how many of them you will use in a single ad, is\na matter of timing and balance as you begin to put your ad together. As\nlong as each additional fresh perspective continues to build the dominant\ndesire in your prospect‚Äôs mind, use it. But if the additional perspective is not\ndifferent or dramatic enough to renew your prospect‚Äôs interest in your\nclaims, then leave it out. To a large degree, this is a matter of sensitivity\nand originality on your part. ÓÅ¢e sensitivity comes from intuition and\nexperience; the originality oÓÇùen comes from nothing more than hard\nwork. And perhaps the best way to measure the balance between the two\n‚Äîthat critical turning point where reinforcement becomes mere\nrepetition‚Äîis to re-read your ad, some days aÓÇùer you have \u0000rst written it.\nÓÅ¢ere are, however, two conventional summary devices which are\nalmost always used, and which must be mentioned here.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst of these is the ‚Äúcatalog‚Äù. ÓÇªis is a brief condensed listing of all\nthe product‚Äôs performances, bene\u0000ts, and/or applications, one aÓÑóer the\nother, without description, dramatization or elaboration. Each of the\nbene\u0000ts or perspectives which might have been given three or four\nparagraphs at the beginning of your ad, is here summed up in a single\nline.\nÓÅ¢ere are two types of catalogs. ÓÅ¢ose that expand desire horizontally,\namong ever-enlarging groups of applications or prospects. And those that\nexpand desire vertically by deepening or magnifying that desire.\nHere is an example of the \u0000rst type of catalog‚Äîused to list all the\napplications of a blow torch kit that might conceivably sell it to a home\nowner:\nALL IN ONE!\nBlow-Torch, Paint-Remover, Soldering Iron!\nProfessional Propane Torch also doubles as fast, safe\nPaint Remover and precision Soldering Iron! Does 101 jobs\n\naround the house, including‚Äî\nLaying tile; removing paint or putty; thawing frozen\npipes; sweating copper tubing; soldering gutters; repairing\nelectrical work; starting charcoal fires and fireplaces:\nburning weeds, parasites and damp leaves; thawing frozen\nlocks; light brazing; loosening rusty bolts; car body and\nfender repairs; soldering aluminum, silver and jewelry and\nother hobbies, and many, many more‚Ä¶\nIt is quite obvious, of course, that this catalog device uses the\n‚Äúshotgun approach.‚Äù Up to this point, your ad has taken a single\ndominant desire, and developed that single desire to the point of absolute\nmaximum intensity. ÓÅ¢is willingness to gamble on being precisely right‚Äî\non having chosen the one most powerful appeal‚Äîgives your ad the\nimpact of a high-velocity ri\u0000e. But it also demands the accuracy of an\nexpert marksman.\nNow‚Äîthrough this multi-appeal catalog listing‚Äîyou have a last-\nminute chance to hedge. Now you ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù with every wide-angled\nappeal, bene\u0000t and application in the book. Before you were heightening\na single desire, by picturing the satisfaction of that desire in a dozen\ndifferent settings.\nNow you are building an effect of a different kind‚Äîone of sheer\nmagnitude, of number, of in\u0000nite possibilities‚Äîin the hope that any one\nof them, or the combination of all of them working together, may provide\nthe extra added push that closes the sale.\nÓÅ¢is catalog technique was born in mail order book selling, and here\nit has its widest application. ÓÅ¢is next example is a continuation of the\nmemory book ad we quoted above:\n‚Ä¶ But this is just the beginning of the ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù you\ncan perform with your memory. This secret is just one of\nthe over 50 MEMORY INTENSIFIERS contained in this\nbook‚Ä¶\nFor instance‚ÄîREMEMBERING NAMES AND FACES! ‚Ä¶\nHow would you like to walk into a room of twenty new\npeople‚Äîmeet each one of them only once‚Äîand then\nremember their names, automatically, for as long as you\nlive ‚Ä¶\n\nThink of the advantage in business, when you can call\nevery customer by his first name, and then ask for his wife\nand children, instantly, by their first names! Think of the\nimpression you‚Äôll make when you ask him about the state\nof his business, his hobbies, when you repeat, almost word\nfor word, the last conversation you had with him. Think of\nbecoming the celebrity at your club‚Äîas the member who\n‚Äúknows everyone‚Äù‚Äîwho can be depended on to avoid\nmistakes, to win new friends for the organization, to get\nthings done!\nBut this is still just the beginning! This book teaches\nyou to remember exactly what you hear and read! ‚Ä¶ It\nteaches you how to memorize a speech or a sales\npresentation in minutes! It teaches you how to remember\nevery card played when you relax at night! ‚Ä¶ It shows you\nhow to improve the depth and force and power of your\nmind! How to double your vocabulary‚Äîlearn dozens of\nways to burn new words into your memory‚Äîlearn their\nmeanings without looking them up‚Äîrepeat entire\nphrases, sentences, paragraphs from the great writers!\nYou‚Äôll be able to learn a foreign language in a few short\nweeks‚Äîat least three to four times as quickly and easily as\nyou could without this system! You‚Äôll be able to hear a\njoke, story or anecdote only once, and then repeat it in the\nsame hilarious way!\nYes! And most important of all, this book will show you\nhow to professionally organize your mind‚Äîdo what you\nhave to do in half the time! You‚Äôll remember dates,\naddresses, appointments‚Äîautomatically! You‚Äôll carry\ndozens of telephone numbers in the file-cabinet of your\nmind! ‚Ä¶ Let me send you this book, and prove these facts\nto you in one short evening, or it doesn‚Äôt cost you a penny!\n‚Ä¶\nÓÅ¢e second use for this catalog technique is to pile desire upon desire,\nrather than application upon application. It is again a building of\nmagnitude, of number‚Äîbut this time in summary of all the perspectives\nthat have gone before. ÓÅ¢is example is taken from the Fish Lure ad\nquoted above:\n\n‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs What This Amazing, Self-Propelled Fish Lure\nDoes For You!\nFirst of all, this Self-Propelled Fish Lure frees you\nforever from the filthy task of digging for worms and\ncrawlers, catching frogs, or paying 50c to $1 for a bucket of\nminnows that die on you before you can even get them in\nthe boat! It frees you forever from paving $3, $4 or even $5\nfor a fancy, ‚Äúdead-as-a-duck‚Äù lure that only works when\nyou tow it‚Äîthat could never actually swim under its own\npower behind you.\nIf frees you forever from long, torturous hours of\ncareful work, tying your own flies and lures, because you\njust couldn‚Äôt buy anything, anywhere, that would reach\nout beyond your farthest casts and pull in the fish for you!\nIt means that tomorrow ‚Ä¶ you can go out in fresh or\nsalt water ‚Ä¶ and haul in the eye-poppers with a lure that\nactually drives them into a frenzy with its crippled minnow\naction and its dying bee sound! It means that you can\nweigh down your boat with big mouthed bass, small\nmouthed bass, cat-fish, dog-fish ‚Ä¶ wherever you drop a\nline!\nIt means that you can fish better‚Äîsound asleep at the\nbottom of your boat‚Äîthan most fishermen sweating and\ncasting till their arms ache with ordinary, ‚Äúdead-as-a-\nduck‚Äù lures!\nAnd it means that you‚Äôll have the time of your life‚Äînot\nonly amazing your friends and family with the hauls you\ndrag home behind you‚Äîbut just watching your fisherman\nfriends‚Äô faces, the first time they see this incredible SELF-\nPROPELLED FISH LURE in action! Their eyes will almost\npop out of their heads!‚Ä¶\nPut Your Guarantee to Work\n13. And \u0000nally, as you close the sale, as you ask the prospect for\naction, as you state the terms of your guarantee, you can turn that\nguarantee into the climax of your ad‚Äîthe last brief summary of your\nproduct‚Äôs performances‚Äîreinforced at every step by the positive reassertion\n\nof that guarantee. Here is an example from the spark plug ad quoted\nabove:\n‚Ä¶ Guaranteed For Two Full Years! Yes! You try these\namazing POWER FLASH SPARK PLUGS for two full years\nentirely at our risk! First, test them for one full month for\nsurging power, thrilling new driving performance, breath-\ntaking gas-savings alone! During that very first month\nalone:\n1.

It is the \u0000rst of the Processes of Persuasion.\nHow to Apply ÓÅ¢ese Principles of\nIntensi\u0000cation to the Campaign\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, we have used\npredominantly mail-order examples to illustrate the mechanism of\nIntensi\u0000cation. We have done this for two reasons. First, because mail\norder customarily uses long copy and hyperbole; and it is through the\nextremes of this long copy and these superlatives that we can see these\ntechniques working most clearly.\nSecondly, we have used mail order for these examples because mail\norder says all it has to say about a product in a single ad. ÓÅ¢ere are no\nmail order ‚Äúcampaigns,‚Äù in the sense of a series of different-though-\nrelated advertisements, appearing one aÓÇùer the other, and based on a\ncommon theme. Mail order compresses such a campaign into a single ad.\nIt says all it can, everything it can think of, in this one ad (which is oÓÇùen\nlaboriously \u0000tted together out of a series of preliminary ads, each of\nwhich contributes some element to the \u0000nished form). And then, when it\nhas proven itself successful, it is frozen‚Äîeven to the point of typography\n‚Äîand run until it has exhausted its potential.\n\nÓÅ¢us, mail order as a rule contains the greatest number of these\nIntensi\u0000cation devices in a single ad; and by studying these mail order\nads we can see them working against each other, complementing each\nother, reinforcing each other, strengthening the overall effect as\nparagraph is piled on paragraph.\nBut in national advertising, the rules change. While mail order is a\nseries of introductions of new products, the average life of which is less\nthan two years, national advertising is concerned with products whose\nlife span is far greater, oÓÇùen approaching the entire life span of\nadvertising itself. And while the mail order advertisement runs once, and\nthen is not repeated for three to six months, national advertising must\nkeep its product image constantly in front of its public, and therefore\nmust run far more frequently.\nÓÅ¢us, national advertising, by its frequent insertions, soon loses its\nimmediate novelty. ÓÅ¢e creative problem in national advertising thus\nchanges from \u0000nding the theme for a particular advertisement to \u0000nding\nthe theme for a series of advertisements. And the problem of\nIntensi\u0000cation shiÓÇùs from building desire throughout the advertisement\nto building desire throughout the series. And an entirely new problem of\nbalance emerges‚Äîthat of keeping continuity throughout the series, by\nmaintaining the dominant image sharp enough and identi\u0000able enough to\nutilize the desire generated by past advertisements, and at the same time\nvarying that image sufficiently to induce the prospect to read it again, and\ntherefore reinforce and sharpen that desire.\nAssuming that you have found your dominant image, your creative\nproblem now becomes two-fold. First, to compress that image into a\nsingle statement or picture, so powerful that it will sell the product the\nvery \u0000rst time it is used, and so true to the heart of your market that it\nwill continue to sell that product, even when it is used over and over\nagain.\nIt is important to realize that‚Äîas the campaign develops‚Äîthis\ndominant image or idea cannot remain as the headline. To present the\nsame basic headline (or lead picture) time aÓÇùer time to the same audience\nwould soon make the campaign unreadable\nÓÅ¢is leads us to your second creative problem. To present a series of\nvariations or perspectives of that central image‚Äîeach emerging from\nyour dominant idea, but each so different from the rest that they impel\n\nyour prospect to read through them, and so fresh that they make that\ndominant idea seem new again.\nÓÅ¢us you have your Central Campaign Idea, and its continuous\nrestatement in a series of fresh disguises. ÓÅ¢ere are as many different ways\nto use this basic technique of campaign construction as there are\nadvertising styles. ÓÅ¢ey range from the most blatant and obvious to the\nmost subtle. To start at the top, in a brief resume of examples, consider\nthe superbly-effective Colgate campaign of the late 1950s. Here the\ncentral idea was openly stated, and precisely repeated, during every\nadvertisement:\n‚ÄúGardol‚Äîthe Invisible Shield that Protects Your Teeth.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢e variations consisted of a series of opening analogies. Using\ntelevision as the most sharply-de\u0000ned example, an invisible shield was\nshown protecting the announcer against baseballs, footballs, etc.‚Äîagainst\nwhich they would simply bounce off. ÓÅ¢e wording of the commercials\nwas ritualistic. Once the initial demonstration was over, there was no\nvariation in the sentences that followed:\n‚ÄúJust as this invisible shield (the announcer raps the\nshield with his knuckles) protects me against this baseball,\nso the invisible shield in Colgate toothpaste protects your\nteeth against decay.‚Äù\nHere the variations are con\u0000ned to the opening demonstration in the\n\u0000rst ten seconds of the commercial. ÓÅ¢ese are designed to startle the\nviewer (the ball being thrown directly at him from within the television\nset) and this emotional reaction is carried over to reinforce the rigidly\nrepeated remainder of the commercial. ÓÅ¢us you have a quick and\nstartling emotional involvement, welded onto a precise selling message.\nEqually as powerful is the technique of repeating the exact verbal\nimage throughout a series of advertisements, while varying and\nfreshening the emotional appeal through a spectrum of constantly\nchanging main illustrations. ÓÅ¢us the dominant image is retained intact\n‚Äîcontinuity is maintained‚Äîbut there is no feeling of over-familiarity or\nboredom. ÓÅ¢is technique might be named ‚ÄúRule and Example.‚Äù Two of its\nmost effective uses recently have been in the hair styling \u0000eld. First with\nToni, where the precisely-repeated verbal image was:\n\n‚ÄúWHICH TWIN HAS THE TONI‚Äîand which has the $15 permanent?‚Äù\nAbove this unvarying headline was a continuously-changing stream\nof pretty girls‚Äîeach new picture making the question new again, and\nrequiring an interplay of examination between the picture and the copy\nto discover the answer.\nÓÅ¢e same technique was used, some years later, by Clairol to sell their\nhair tint. Here the Rule was expressed in the precisely-repeated headline:\n‚ÄúDOES SHE OR DOESN‚ÄôT SHE?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHair-coloring so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure.‚Äù\nHere again, this headline was re-invigorated by a series of main\nillustrations, of attractive young women, in common but glamorized\nevery-day activities, enjoying their lives. Here again the Examples not\nonly proved the Rule, but renewed it.\nAt the other extreme, however, the dominant image may not even\nappear in the advertisements themselves, but may merely be the\nunderlying theme for the campaign as a whole. Here the continuity is\nretained‚Äînot by a precisely-repeated slogan or statement‚Äîbut by a\nsingle, rigidly-maintained focal point. ÓÅ¢is focal point may be a\ndominant product appeal‚Äîsuch as the Cadillac quality, which is\nsymbolized in every Cadillac advertisement in the identi\u0000cation\nbackground photography, in the typography, in the copy style, in the\nfashions and jewelry that are chosen to appear with the car, and the credit\nlines that are given to them‚Äîeven to the highly-stylized pen-and-ink\ndrawings that are used when the campaign shiÓÇùs to newspapers.\nOr, if it so merits, the focal point may be simply the product itself. In\nsuch a campaign, each succeeding advertisement reveals another fact\nabout the product. Each is completely different; no single phrase or\nslogan is repeated twice. Here the variations comprise the entire verbal\ncontent of the advertisements. But their subject-matter, and the\nillustrations, are always the same‚Äîthe product.\nPerhaps the best example of this technique is the magni\u0000cent\nVolkswagen magazine campaign. Here the advertisements are reduced to\nsevere simplicity. ÓÅ¢ere is no background identi\u0000cation whatsoever.\nDifferent perspectives of the product are shown as close-up as possible\n\n(except in the ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ink Small‚Äù advertisement) against an absolutely bare\nbackground.\nAgainst this rigid focus on the car itself, to the exclusion of every\nother visual element, the series of copy messages presents a complete\nexploration of even facet of the car‚Äôs performance, utility, economy,\ndurability service facilities and what-have-you. Any single advertisement\nis sufficient to interest a prospective buyer. Together, especially when\nconcentrated in the same media and reaching the same audience week\naÓÇùer week, the series builds an overwhelming impression of novelty and\nvalue‚Äîthe theme of an Honest Car. Here, as examples, are only a few of\nthe dozens of different headlines:\n‚ÄúTHINK SMALL.‚Äù\n(ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst in the series, discussing the merits of compactness as an\nasset.)\n‚ÄúLemon.‚Äù\n(Showing what appears to be a perfectly good car, and discussing the\nmicroscopic, almost unnoticeable \u0000aw in it that disquali\u0000ed it.)\n‚ÄúOur new model.‚Äù\n(A car that shows no difference, but has dozens of essential\nengineering changes inside the car, where they won‚Äôt make present\nmodels obsolete.)\n‚ÄúWhy you should open the window before you close the door of a\nVolkswagen.‚Äù\n(Discussing the fact that the car is airtight, and the quality that this\nfact symbolizes.)\n‚ÄúOur number one salesman.‚Äù\n(ÓÅ¢e serviceman, of course, typifying the quality of care the VW\nowner gets, and combatting the conception that foreign cars give sparse\nservice.)\nAnd so on. A series of building-block advertisements, making no\nattempt to tell the complete story in themselves, relying on their ability to\ngrasp the prospective buyer and carry him through a procession of short,\n\nsharply focused sales stories that combine to give an informed desire of\ntremendous depth.\nNotice, incidentally, that each of these headlines ful\u0000lls the\nrequirements necessary to place it at the top of an ad. Each of them\nreaches out and touches the prospect at the point of his dominant desire\n(to get more value for his car money). Each expresses the common theme\nof the campaign (this is an honest car). And each moves the prospect into\nthe body copy‚Äîit gets him to read the complete, though brief, selling\nmessage. (ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst second, third and \u0000ÓÇùh headline do this through\npresenting the reader with an apparent contradiction‚Äîin the \u0000rst case,\nwith his accepted notion of ‚Äúthinking big,‚Äù and in the remaining\nadvertisements, between the message of the headline and the content of\nthe photograph above it‚Äîthus compelling the reader to go through the\nbody copy to resolve the contradiction. ÓÅ¢e fourth does it in promising\nthe reader information explaining an unusual and provocative request).\nNotice also that to accomplish this novelty-within-continuity, and to\ngrasp the attention of the prospect over a series of advertisements, and to\nmove him into the body copy where he can be sold more thoroughly,\neach of these headlines takes the ‚ÄúCreative Gamble.‚Äù ÓÅ¢e product, its\ntrademark, or its performance is not mentioned in the headline. ÓÇªe copy\nwriter is taking the position that he can only sell adequately with the\nnumber of words allowed him by the body copy. ÓÅ¢erefore he is willing to\nrisk his headline in grasping the attention of his prospect and impelling\nhim to read on, into the sales message itself, presented in convincing\ndetail below. If he fails in his gamble, he has wasted his page. If he\nsucceeds, he has doubled and tripled the effectiveness of his ad.\n\n3\n-\nTHE SECOND TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY: IDENTIFICATION\nHow to Build a Saleable Personality Into Your\nProduct\nÓÅ¢e desires, wants, needs and cravings of mankind that we have just\ndiscussed are, above all, obvious. ÓÅ¢e hungry man feels the contractions\nin his stomach; the sick man feels his pain. ÓÅ¢e woman who is overweight\nfeels her embarrassment, her discomfort, her shame. ÓÅ¢e desire for\nsatisfaction, or for relief, displays itself openly. It announces both its\nwants and its needs. It responds whole-heartedly and immediately to\nmechanisms that achieve its aims.\nÓÅ¢erefore, the recognition and magni\u0000cation of this desire is the \u0000rst\nand most obvious task of copy writing. All the principles and techniques\ndescribed in the last chapter were practiced to perfection by the patent-\nmedicine copy writers of the 1890‚Äôs. Before the First World War, Claude\nHopkins had liÓÇùed them out of patent-medicine and established them in\nevery category of general advertising. Until 1954, they literally dominated\nadvertising.\nBut there is another kind of desire that exists in the human mind‚Äîfar\nmore subtle, partly unconscious, longing not for satisfaction, but for\nexpression. ÓÅ¢is second kind of desire is so different from the \u0000rst, and\noperates under such different rules, that it can justly be described as a\nsecond dimension of the human mind. It may be titled the Longing for\nIdenti\u0000cation. Its rise to prominence as a buying motive marks the great\nrevolution in merchandising of our time. Its utilization in copy writing‚Äî\nas an adjunct to desire-building‚Äîconstitutes our second Mechanism of\nPersuasion ‚Ä¶ that of building the proper Identi\u0000cation into your product.\nA Personal Note\nLet me just inject a personal note here on the names I have given\nthese Techniques (or processes) I believe you should use to cumulatively\nstrengthen your copy. As I mention in the Introduction, I have never\nheard, or read, a discussion of many of these techniques before.\n\nÓÅ¢erefore, they are not part of the common advertising terminology, and\nin case aÓÇùer case actually have no names.\nBecause of this fact, I‚Äôve had to invent names for them. Some of these\nnames convey their meaning at \u0000rst glance, such as Intensi\u0000cation. Other\nnames I‚Äôve put together out of two or more ordinary words, such as\nGradualization, to try to convey an idea that has purposely been leÓÇù\nambiguous when you \u0000rst encounter it. And in still other cases, such as\nthe Identi\u0000cation technique discussed in this chapter, I‚Äôve used terms you\nalready know and stretched their meaning.\nIdenti\u0000cation here, for example, means more than the customer‚Äôs\nprocess of identifying with a product personality, or even with a group of\nprestige users of that product. Here, in this new context I have given it, it\nmeans at the same time the active process by which the copy writer\ncapitalizes on this need for identi\u0000cation by building its realization\nthrough his copy into his product.\nÓÅ¢e stress is always, in all these techniques, on the word active. ÓÅ¢ese\nare the activities you must accomplish ‚Ä¶ the processes you must utilize\n‚Ä¶ the psychological effects you must achieve to give your copy the\nmaximum possible strength. It is this active, deliberate, ongoing process\n‚Äîthis building of effects‚Äîthat I have tried to convey by these terms.\nÓÅ¢e Roles Your Prospect Desires\nWhat, exactly, is this process of Identi\u0000cation? Quite simply, it is, \u0000rst\nof all, the desire of your prospect to act out certain roles in his life.\nIt is the desire of your prospect to de\u0000ne himself to the world around\nhim‚Äîto express the qualities within himself that he values, and the\npositions he has attained.\nAnd how do you utilize this longing for identi\u0000cation when you write\nyour copy? In two ways: First, by turning your product into an\ninstrument for achieving these roles. And second, by turning that\nproduct into an acknowledgement that these roles have already been\nachieved.\nEvery product you work on should offer your prospect two separate\nand distinct reasons for buying it. First, it should offer him the ful\u0000llment\nof a physical want or need. ÓÅ¢is is the satisfaction your product gives him.\nAnd second, it should offer him a particular method of ful\u0000lling that need,\n\nwhich de\u0000nes him to the outside world as a particular kind of human\nbeing.\nÓÅ¢is is the role your product offers to your prospect. It is the non-\nfunctional, super-functional value of that product. And it is built into that\nproduct‚Äînot by engineering‚Äîbut by merchandising alone.\nFor example, only the poor man today buys food for its physical\nsatisfactions alone. ÓÅ¢e average American today selects his food. Selects\nfoods that he believes are modern, because he wishes to be up-to-date.\nSelects foods that are non-fattening, because he wishes to be youthful and\nslim. Selects foods that come from every country and re\u0000ect every taste\non earth, because he wishes to be cosmopolitan, adventurous and\nsophisticated.\nÓÅ¢is man no longer buys food for food alone. He has gained or he has\nbeen given, a whole new vocabulary of wants. He now buys, not only\nobjects, but roles. His life becomes devoted to a quest for\nacknowledgements‚Äî‚Äúup-to-date‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúslim‚Äù ‚Ä¶\n‚Äúcosmopolitan‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúadventurous‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù in this one\ninstance alone.\nAnd because of this multiplication of wants, this man gives you\nhundreds of new ways to focus his attention, to stimulate his desire, to\nbuild up that desire to the point of purchase. Every new role that he\ncovets‚Äîevery new longing-for-identi\u0000cation that he develops‚Äîgives you\none more mass desire that you can harness to your product.\nWhat are these roles? Where do they come from? How do they\noperate? How do you put them to work for your product? First of all‚Äîthe\nroles themselves. ÓÅ¢ere are two kinds. ÓÅ¢ere are roles that de\u0000ne\ncharacter. And there are roles that express achievement. Let‚Äôs glance\nbrie\u0000y at each:\n1. Character Roles\nUsually expressed by adjectives, or adjectives-turned-nouns. For\ninstance‚Äî‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúchic‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcharming‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwell-\nread.‚Äù ÓÅ¢ey are a part of the personality of your prospect. ÓÅ¢ey belong to\nhim. His task is to pick out the ones he values most, and to develop them.\nAnd then to turn the spotlight of other people‚Äôs attention onto them, one\naÓÇùer the other.\n\nAttainment of these character roles‚Äîmastery of them‚Äîis not\nenough. Once they have been mastered, they must then be\nacknowledged, valued and admired, or they are worthless.\nHere again, your product can serve your prospect in three distinct\nways‚Äîbeyond its physical satisfactions‚Äîin this constant search for self-\nde\u0000nition. First, it can help him achieve mastery of his chosen character\nroles‚Äîsuch as a book on philosophy, if he wishes to be thought of as\nwell-read.\nSecond, it can help simplify condense or speed up this mastery‚Äîsuch\nas a Speed-Reading Course.\nAnd third, and most important, it can serve as a symbol of that\nmastery to invoke the acknowledgement or admiration of his friends‚Äî\nsuch as a shelf to house both books.\nYou must realize that every one of these values goes far beyond the\nphysical satisfactions of the products themselves. ÓÅ¢ey are supra-\nfunctional, and therefore add an extra incentive for purchase.\nÓÅ¢e book on philosophy might not have been purchased if the\nprospect wished only to satisfy his academic curiosity, and did not also\nwish to enlighten his friends in conversation. ÓÅ¢e Speed-Reading Course\nmight not have been purchased if the prospect wished only to absorb\nmore information in a shorter period of time, and did not also wish to\nuse that information to get ahead in both his business and social life. And\ncertainly the book-shelves would not have been of the same \u0000ne quality,\n\u0000nish and luxury if the prospect had only wished to use them as a store-\nhouse, and not also as a showpiece.\nAt least half of all purchases made today cannot he understood in terms\nof function alone. It would be absurd for a man to spend $5,000 for a 150-\nmile-an-hour sports car for functional reasons, when he only uses it to\ndrive to and from work on congested, 35-mile-an-hour parkways. His\nwillingness to spend this money only becomes rational when you take\none further fact into consideration‚Äîthat this 150-mile-an-hour top\nspeed, this handgear-shiÓÇù, this fantastic cornering ability all give him as\ntheir owner the role of ‚Äúsportsman‚Äù‚Äîand very probably ‚Äúsuccessful\nsportsman‚Äù at that.\nEvery product can bene\u0000t from this role-giving power. But there are\nmany products where this ability of character-reinforcement‚Äîwhether\nbuilt into that product by design, by society or by advertising‚Äîfar\n\noutweighs in sales value the built-in performance of that product. In such\nproducts, it is the role-giving function that sells, and not the performance.\nOne further fact distinguishing these character roles. Since they are\nnot created by society but by the prospect himself, and since they are\nalmost never claimed openly but only hinted at, implied and prompted,\ntherefore they can never truly be tested or measured, and they are\nambiguous. ÓÅ¢ey are subject to error. And, more important, they are\nsubject to fantasy.\nGreat areas of these character roles literally exist in the subconscious.\nÓÅ¢ey are never given de\u0000nite words. ÓÅ¢ey are not stated or discussed, but\nsubtly expressed in symbols and images. Only rarely does the prospect\neven de\u0000ne them to himself. And even more rarely does he test them\nagainst the outside world, to see if they are actually true.\nÓÅ¢erefore, your prospect is far more ready to believe in the character\nroles you assign to him, than he is to believe in either your product‚Äôs\nperformance claims, or the achievement roles it may offer him. If the\ncharacter role is \u0000attering, such as ‚Äúvirility,‚Äù and if it is subtly expressed in\na non-verbal image-symbol, such as a test pilot smoking a cigarette, than\nthe prospect can easily persuade himself that the same action, smoking,\nperformed on the same product, the cigarette, conveys to him at least\nsome of the implied virility of the genuine possessor‚Äîin this case, the\npilot.\nÓÅ¢ere is no direct claim made in the advertisement. No verbalization\nto be passed on by the conscious, rational mind. No test situation called\nfor where the prospect must prove that the role is valid. Acceptance is\neasy painless, non-demanding.\nÓÅ¢is is not true of a performance claim, which must be justi\u0000ed in\nterms of concrete results to our friends. Nor is it true of an achievement\nrole, which must stand up to the harsh reality of our position in everyday\nlife. ÓÅ¢is superb ease-of-acceptance, this consolation-without-cost feature\nof the character role is its great strength, and the reason why it should be\nused to supplement the verbal claims in every ad.\n2. Achievement Roles\nÓÅ¢ese are the status roles ‚Ä¶ class roles ‚Ä¶ position roles that are\ncreated by every society on earth, and offered to the men and women\nwho can earn them. In a civilization as complex as ours, there are literally\n\nhundreds of them‚Äîusually expressed by nouns, with the nouns serving\nas titles.\nFor example, for men, there are‚Äî‚ÄúExecutive‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHome Owner‚Äù ‚Ä¶\n‚Äú$20,000-a-year-Man‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFive Handicap‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMan-On-His-Way-Up‚Äù ‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúBlock Chairman‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and dozens more, embracing every activity of our\nlives.\nFor women, the primary achievement role to be won is ‚ÄúWife,‚Äù and\nfrom then on‚Äî‚ÄúFashion Setter‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCareer Woman‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúGood Mother‚Äù\n‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCivic Leader‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPower-Behind-the-ÓÅ¢rone‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPatron of the Arts‚Äù\n‚Ä¶ and on, and on.\nÓÅ¢e list, for both men and women, is endless. Each of these roles is an\nachievement to be won, and held, and‚Äîmost of all‚Äîdisplayed.\nHere display is vital‚Äîbecause none of these achievements is obvious.\nQuite the opposite, they are immaterial and invisible‚Äîmere titles, roles,\nbundles of privilege. ÓÅ¢ey do exist‚Äîthey are real‚Äîand once they are\ngained, they have great potential to alter our lives. But that potential must\n\u0000rst be translated into physical symbols of success, for everyone around\nus to see.\nAnd the easiest and most universally acknowledged symbols of\nsuccess in America today are the products we can buy. Products that are\npurchased‚Äînot by any stretch of the imagination for their physical function\nalone‚Äîbut for the de\u0000nition they give us as their possessors. In America\ntoday we are known‚Äînot only by the company we keep‚Äîbut by the\nproducts we own.\nÓÅ¢e most obvious example is the newly-wed woman. Her \u0000rst act in\nher new role as ‚ÄúWife‚Äù is to receive a physical giÓÇù, which has absolutely\nno function other than to de\u0000ne her‚Äîthe wedding ring in which she is\nmarried. Weeks before this, she has literally been shedding closets-full of\nclothes‚Äîclothes that still \u0000tted her physically, but not socially‚Äîin order\nto replace them with a new material personality, her trousseau.\nHer sheets and linens are new. Her furniture and carpeting are new.\nEven the very roof over her head, today, in our society must be new.\nBecause she is literally a new woman‚Äîher new role has transformed her\n‚Äîand she must express that transformation in everything she owns.\nÓÅ¢e same principle applies to every aspect of all of our lives. Every\nsocial role that we achieve in life is immediately translated into those\npossessions which we believe express that position most clearly. And as we\nacquire these possessions throughout our life, what we are doing is\n\nconstructing for ourselves a ‚Äúmaterial personality,‚Äù that we carry with us\nwherever we go, and whose function it is to de\u0000ne us, instantly, to\nwhomever we meet.\nÓÅ¢e ‚ÄúMan-On-His-Way-Up,‚Äù for example, trades in his Ford for a\nBuick, and, when he becomes an ‚ÄúExecutive,‚Äù trades in his Buick for a\nCadillac. ÓÅ¢e ‚ÄúCareer Woman‚Äù needs an entirely different wardrobe than\nthe one she owned as a ‚ÄúHousewife.‚Äù And when the man of the house gets\na raise, the house either grows bigger, or prettier, or more \u0000lled with\nstatus-de\u0000ners of every description‚Äîor the house itself is discarded, to be\nreplaced by one more be\u0000tting the new character of its possessor.\nHow to Put ÓÅ¢ese Longings for Identi\u0000cation\nto Work for Your Product\nÓÅ¢us products become more than products. In addition to their\nphysical functions, they take on new immaterial functions as status\nde\u0000ners. ÓÅ¢ey announce our achievements, de\u0000ne our role in life,\ndocument our success.\nAll products may bene\u0000t from this power to de\u0000ne. But in particular,\nwhen you have a product that does the same job as its competitors, and is\nso priced that price is no longer a factor, then the prospect‚Äôs choice will\nalmost overwhelmingly depend on the difference in role that your product\noffers him. And it is your job to create this role for him in your ad.\nÓÅ¢e performance of this job‚Äîthe process of building these character\nand achievement roles into your product, to be used by your prospect‚Äîis\nthe process of Identi\u0000cation, our second mechanism of persuasion.\nAnd just as the wish for this identi\u0000cation by your prospect is a\nspecial form of desire‚Äîthe desire, not for satisfaction, but for recognition\n‚Äîso the method you use to put it to work for your product follows\nexactly the same pattern of discovery and magni\u0000cation that you would\nuse for any other desire.\nFirst, your job is to discover exactly what kinds of character and\nachievement roles your prospect is ready to identify with your product‚Äî\nwhat kind of roles he will reject for that product‚Äîand which of the\naccepted roles is the most compelling. And then you must present those\nchosen roles in such a way‚Äîso vividly and so intensely‚Äîthat the role you\nare projecting will become virtually irresistible.\n\nOnce again, it is your market itself that presents you with both your\nopportunities and your limitations. And it is your own personal skill as a\ncopy writer that determines how effectively you side-step those\nlimitations, and how fully you realize the potential of your opportunities.\nFirst of all‚Äîthe limitations. Above everything else, of course, you\ncannot force your market to accept an unrealistic identi\u0000cation. People\nassign certain characteristics to certain products. ÓÅ¢ese characteristics\nmay arise out of the product itself‚Äîits structure or performance, its\nhistory, its cost to produce or sell. Or they may stem from the role or\nroles that it plays in their lives today‚Äîor that similar products play in\ntheir lives‚Äîor that these products play in the lives of other people, whom\nthey have seen, heard or read about.\nÓÅ¢ese characteristics may be true or false, super\u0000cial or profound,\n\u0000attering or libelous. But as far as your product is concerned, they are as\nhard as rock‚Äîand just as determinative. ÓÅ¢ey exist. ÓÅ¢ey are facts. ÓÅ¢ey\ncannot be changed. If you try to break through them and establish a\ncontradictory image, you will learn that they form the walls of a prison.\nBut if you decide to build on to them‚Äîto use them as a foundation\nfor sharper, coordinated images, which may be even broader and more\nappealing‚Äîthen, if necessary, you can turn those apparent limitations\ninto the strongest selling points in your ad.\nNot every product needs this technique, of course. Speaking in terms\nof identi\u0000cation potential, there are two kinds of products. One is the\nproduct with built-in prestige‚Äîthe sports car, the swimming pool, the\ndiamond bracelet. ÓÅ¢ese rare and expensive products already embody the\nidenti\u0000cation appeals most Americans want. ÓÅ¢ey actually symbolize\nthese appeals success, achievement, adventure, self-indulgence,\nexclusivity‚Äîso unquestionably that they can be used to weld these same\nvalues onto other products.\nBut these other products‚Äîby far the overwhelming majority of the\nproducts you will be given to work with‚Äîhave no such built-in prestige.\nIt is up to you to create their prestige for them. And you must do this by\nbuilding on the characteristics they already possess‚Äîby using these accepted\ncharacteristics as a bridge‚Äîbetween the product‚Ä¶ the image it already has\n‚Ä¶ and the prestige-\u0000lled image that you want to wind up with.\nWe now have all the tools we need to build identi\u0000cation values for\nour product. We realize that identi\u0000cation longings are a separate and\n\nimmensely powerful form of desire‚Äîa desire, not for physical\nsatisfaction, but for expression and recognition.\nÓÅ¢ese longings for identi\u0000cation are two-fold. We all wish to express\nour character, and we all wish to gain recognition for our\naccomplishments.\nBut we cannot do this openly‚Äîverbally. We cannot go around\nboasting how virile we are, or how rich we are. So we symbolize these\nprestige claims. We express them in terms of products‚Äîand we buy\nproducts that express them.\nAs Americans, living in our culture and our century, there are certain\ncharacter roles and certain achievement roles that we value more than\nothers. ÓÅ¢e most general and compelling of these are: the wish to be virile\nor feminine‚Äîthe wish to be exciting, unique, fun-\u0000lled and adventurous\n‚Äîthe wish to be friendly and well-liked‚Äîthe wish to be important,\nin\u0000uential and correct‚Äîthe wish to be modern and up-to-date‚Äîand\nabove all, the wish to be successful, to make something of our lives.\nÓÅ¢ese are the roles most Americans buy. In some splinter markets,\nother, contradictory roles may apply. But, in the mass, these are the\ncharacteristics that will turn the prospects from one brand to another.\nÓÅ¢e Primary Image of Your Product\nÓÅ¢ere is a critical point that separates the process of building\nidenti\u0000cation from the process of building desire, namely, that the\nproduct you are given has its own personality at the moment you are given\nit. It has its own characteristics. And these characteristics may contradict\nwhat most Americans want‚Äîor simply not include them‚Äîor simply not\ninclude as many of them as you want.\nFor example, a cigarette is not, by itself, a symbol of success. But you\nrealize that if you could make it a symbol of success, you could sell many\nmore of them. Nor is a piston ring, by itself, a symbol of virility‚Äîeven\nthough that virility image, if you could create it, would sell many more\npiston rings. And, though household appliances are not, at \u0000rst glance,\nsymbols of femininity, women would buy many more of them if they\ncould somehow be made feminine.\nHow do you do this? In two steps‚Äîthe \u0000rst of which is to identify the\nprimary image that each of these products already has in the mind of\nyour prospects. For instance, a cigarette is virile in almost everyone‚Äôs\n\nmind. And a piston ring is precision-machined and full of mechanical\nbeauty to almost every man. And household appliances are time-saving,\nby virtue of the very functions they perform.\nÓÅ¢ese are the primary images of the products you are called on to sell.\nÓÅ¢ese are the accepted images that they already have in your prospect‚Äôs\nmind. Your job now is to use these already-accepted images as raw\nmaterial, as a starting point to construct new, double, triple, and quadruple\nimages, which draw in more of these most-wanted roles into your product-\npersonality, and multiply its identi\u0000cation appeal.\nYou do this in two ways:\nFirst, by changing the intensity of your primary image. By emphasizing\nand dramatizing that primary image, if it is already acceptable. Or by\ntoning it down, if it is negative or neutral.\nFor example, the male virility naturally associated with cigarettes is a\nde\u0000nite sales aid, even with women. ÓÅ¢e sheer physical act of smoking‚Äî\nof ‚Äúplaying with \u0000re‚Äù‚Äîof ‚Äúbreathing \u0000re‚Äù‚Äîhas been for centuries an\nassertion of manhood and of daring.\nBut Marlboro took this image of virility and intensi\u0000ed it‚Äîdeepened\nit‚Äîin three ways. First, they presented men who were, in themselves,\nvirile. Second, they presented these men in situations or occupations that\ndemand virility. And third, they took the further ‚ÄúCreative Gamble‚Äù of\naffixing to these men‚Äôs hands one of the most primitive symbols of virility\nknown to history‚Äîthe tattoo. A single dominant emotion‚Äîvirility‚Äî\nsymbolized three ways. ÓÅ¢e impact of repetition reinforced through\nvariation. Far more powerful‚Äîfar more eye-catching‚Äîfar more\nappealing than any one of these images could have been by itself.\nSo far, there has been no difference between this technique and the\nintensi\u0000cation of desire we discussed previously. Although we are\nspeaking here in visual terms, the mechanics are exactly the same‚Äîthe\nintensi\u0000cation of an already-existing emotion in your prospect, through a\nseries of reinforcing images expressing the ful\u0000llment of that emotion.\nWith certain, naturally-favored products, this process of\nintensi\u0000cation may be all that is required‚Äîthough even Marlboro, as\nmentioned below, goes beyond it. But‚Äîand this point is imperative‚Äî\nthough the process of intensifying desire for your product ends here, the\nprocess of building the proper identi\u0000cation for your product‚Äîof\nbuilding prestige for that product‚Äîonly begins here.\n\nFor the primary image of your product may not be favorable. It may\nbe negative‚Äîcontradicting the roles most people want to play. Or it may\nsimply be neutral‚Äîa wall\u0000ower product‚Äîoffering most people no\nemotional reaction at all.\nIn both these cases, your \u0000rst suggestion may be to simply discard\nthese primary images altogether, and substitute more favorable ones. ÓÅ¢is\nhas been done in countless advertisements. And it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîfor a\nvery simple reason. Because people just won‚Äôt believe that a product is\nwhat it isn‚Äôt. You cannot contradict accepted images or beliefs in advertising.\nÓÅ¢is is not advertising‚Äôs role. Nor is it really necessary.\nIn order to overcome these unfavorable images, you simply\nincorporate them in a larger, overall image‚Äîlower their emotional\nintensity‚Äîand use them as readily-accepted bridges to lead your prospect\ninto far more compelling appeals.\nHow to Build New Images Into Your Product\nÓÅ¢is is a single process, but it is made up of two steps. First, as\nmentioned above, a change in the intensity of your primary image‚Äîin\nthis case, subordinating it even though you retain it. And second, using it\nas a logical link to bring in any number of more favorable images.\nOne of the most striking examples is the Chester\u0000eld ad of 1926\n‚Äî‚ÄúBlow Some My Way‚Äù‚Äîfully examined in Chapter 3.\nHere is pure identi\u0000cation advertising‚Äîdealing with an unfavorable\nimage of two generations‚Äô standing‚Äîthat cigarettes are a ‚Äúman‚Äôs product.‚Äù\nAlthough the objective of the campaign was to make smoking, and\nsmoking situations, more acceptable to women, it would have been\nimpossible to do this by picturing the woman alone. ÓÅ¢e idea that women\nwould practice this Masculine act in private, or with each other, was\ninadmissible. ÓÅ¢erefore the man must be retained. ÓÅ¢e accepted image\nmust be acknowledged.\nBut he undergoes two vital transformations. First, he is subdued. His\n\u0000gure is darkened, almost blended into invisibility with the background.\nAnd his position in the picture‚Äîhis posture‚Äîthe arrangement of his\nhands and face as the light plays over them‚Äîall direct the attention of the\nviewer past the man himself and into the focal point of the picture, the\nwoman sitting beside him.\n\nÓÅ¢us he becomes a mere suggestion of man, leading the viewer into a\nfar more appealing overall image‚Äîthat of a handsome young couple,\nalone together on a moonlit beach, heightened emotionally with the\ncarefully-blended-in suggestions of escape, intimacy, and a sense of\nshared daring.\nBecause the primary image is there‚Äîbecause the smoking is done by\nthe man‚Äîthe viewer, even a well-brought up woman of the 1920s,\naccepts the situation. But this acceptance, once established, goes far beyond\nthat primary image. ÓÅ¢is feminine viewer is also willing to accept the\nromance of the overall scene‚Äîincluding its emotional undertones of\nescape from the conventional rules and boundaries, and its feelings of\nrelaxation and liberty. She is now willing to project herself into this scene.\nAnd in accepting the scene as a whole, she is \u0000nally led to accepting\nthe climactic words, ‚ÄúBlow some my way,‚Äù as being a perfectly natural\nand acceptable action for her to take, with all its implications for her\nconduct in the future.\nÓÅ¢is, then, is the process of identi\u0000cation‚Äîof building prestige for\nyour product. To weave favorable social and character images into the\npersonality of your product, in order to reinforce and even dominate\nthose primary images that your product already has.\nÓÅ¢ere is only one limit to the number, or the range of favorable\nimages that you can add to that product personality. Simply that you must\nalways include the primary image as their base. ÓÅ¢ey must emerge from\nthat primary image, and they must be logically consistent with its\nbroadest de\u0000nition.\nFor example, to return to Marlboro, once you have developed the\nprimary image to its peak of intensity then there is absolutely nothing to\nstop you from weaving other powerful appeals into this base.\nConnotations of success can be included by the model‚Äôs clothes, such as\nthe tuxedo worn in the \u0000rst ads, or by the possessions he holds.\nAdventure and excitement can be suggested by the situation you picture\nhim in, such as on a boat, in a plane, riding horseback, etc. Romance by a\nyoung girl, mystery and affairs of great importance by a dark background\nor a briefcase, culture and intellectual achievement by a rare book or an\nantique telescope.\nAs a matter of fact, many visual symbols, by themselves,\ncommunicate several different roles of great appeal at the same time. For\nexample, the single image of ownership of a \u0000ne painting may express,\n\nnot only success, but also cultural breeding and intellectual\naccomplishment.\nSuch multi-image symbols perform two vital tasks for your product.\nÓÅ¢ey broaden the size of its market by graÓÇùing on new emotional appeals\n‚Äîsocial and character identi\u0000cations that reach into the fringe areas of\nthat market‚Äîthat intrigue people who would not be sufficiently swayed\nby the pure functional values of your product. And second, by adding in\nthese many-sided emotional images, they deepen and intensify the\nemotional attraction felt for your product by all the men and women who\nmake up that market.\nPerhaps this can best be shown by taking a hypothetical example, of a\nproduct with strictly neutral primary images, and developing, and\nweaving together, a network of far stronger emotional images for it.\nLet‚Äôs start with piston rings, and assume that a new type of piston ring\nhas just been developed, that lasts longer and therefore saves oil and gas.\nOur body copy, of course, develops this saving theme. We have exploited\nthe functional advantages of the product as far as possible. We are now\nready to reinforce these bene\u0000ts by expanding the product‚Äôs social and\ncharacter appeals.\nWe start by taking inventory. We have a product‚Äîpiston rings. It has\nonly a few primary images‚Äîmechanical, precision-made, unseen.\nNothing exciting here. It also has a primary situation‚Äîreplacement, and\nalways by a mechanic, and usually only when there‚Äôs trouble.\nÓÅ¢ese primary images are either neutral or negative. But they‚Äôre all we\nhave to work with. ÓÅ¢ey, and they alone, must form the foundation, must\nset the direction, for every other appeal we bring into the overall image\nwe are constructing.\nSo we know that we must deal with the act of replacement, and that\nthe replacement must be done by a mechanic. ÓÅ¢ese are our limitations‚Äî\nbut once we observe them, we turn them into the starting point for the true\nemotional message ice want to broadcast through our ad. We take each of\nthese primary elements, and glamorize, dramatize and emotionalize them\nto the brink.\nÓÅ¢e car itself‚Äîwhat kind of car shall it be? Certainly not a beat-up\nfamily sedan. Why not a Mercedes SL-300‚Äîa $12,000 sports car with its\ndistinctive grill-work sides, and all the emotional extras of power, speed,\nskill-in-handling, plus sophistication, success and downright excitement.\n\nNow the garage‚Äîwhat should it look like? A sports-car shop, of\ncourse. Neat, clean, precise. With high-power equipment gleaming\nchrome and steel‚Äîhanging on the walls, ready on the shelves, being\ninstalled on other sports models in the background. ÓÅ¢e mechanic is not\nyoung, not old, simply mature. Rugged, knowledgeable, precise. He‚Äôs sure\nof what he‚Äôs doing‚Äîthere isn‚Äôt a wasted motion or a wasted tool anywhere\nabout him.\nÓÅ¢e owner of the car is young, wiry, virile, but he too has been\naround. Put into words, these images must take on a measure of disbelief,\nwhich we express by saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúcorny.‚Äù However, expressed in visual\nterms, where they can be symbolized, and therefore implied rather than\nnamed, they enter into our minds unnoticed, and we accept them\nwithout question. Verbal terms‚Äîwords and sentences‚Äîcan be used to\nimply images of identi\u0000cation; but these are different types of images, and\nmust be conveyed in a different way. We will touch on this verbal image\nbuilding again, as related to excitement and mood, in Chapter 14.\nÓÅ¢e owner is not a professional driver, but he races the car for sport\n(we know this by the roll-over bar over the back of the seats). He loves\nthis car (its perfect shine, its gleaming chrome engine, its complete\nabsence of even a spot of dirt). He too is precise (the chronometer on his\nwrist). And he carries his success with a complete casualness (the absence\nof any special driving out\u0000t‚Äîjust slacks and a sport shirt).\nAnd what about the relationship between the two men? Knowledge\ncomplementing skill. ÓÅ¢e expert in one \u0000eld advising the expert in\nanother. Comfort, understanding, teamwork‚Äîleading to mutual\nachievement.\nAnd what are they doing? Replacing rings, of course. But not because\nthe old rings have developed trouble (nothing in this car would be leÓÇù\nunchecked long enough to have developed a \u0000aw). But because this\nmechanic is installing these new rings in this car as high-performance\nequipment, exactly as he would install a supercharger to increase its\nhorsepower.\nEverything about the picture‚Äîits camera angle, its composition, its\nlighting, the angle of the men‚Äôs heads and arms as they examine the rings\n‚Äîdevelops the emotion of precision and the excitement and drama of\ndiscovering new performance through greater and greater precision.\nIt is a picture, a situation and a mood that invites participation. ÓÅ¢e\nreader may not notice every emotional detail that you have developed;\n\nbut he will sense the excitement and pleasure that you have built up. He\nwill wish to share in this world. And he will buy the product that gives\nhim this world‚Äîthat offers it as a bonus to all its functional and physical\nsatisfactions.\nOn the Limits to the Images Your Prospects Will\nIdentify With\nI must insert a warning here. Although these identi\u0000cation images are\nimmensely powerful when used correctly, there are also strict rules and\nlimits to their use. And, if they are used incorrectly, they can be\ndisastrous.\nMany campaigns have collapsed because they have asked their market\nto identify themselves with an unbelievable image. For example, the\ndeodorant-soap campaign of several years ago that used an elite, society\nimage to sell the mass market. ÓÅ¢e men and women who composed the\nmarket could not make the jump between themselves and the characters\npictured in the ad. And they not only refused to believe the suggested\nidenti\u0000cation, but the disbelief spread to the performance claims\nthemselves and killed the sales.\nÓÅ¢e key to avoiding such mistakes, of course, is the structure of the\nword, unbelievable. What makes an image‚Äîor a claim, or an idea‚Äî\nbelievable or not believable? We shall discuss this question thoroughly in\nthe next few chapters. However, in relation to image-building, the answer\nlies in two points:\n1. What do people already believe about the personality of your\nproduct? Do they believe, today, that it has the character traits that you\nsay it has? And‚Äîif they do‚Äîcan they identify themselves, their lives,\ntheir present position in society, or their next step up in society with\nthese traits?\nIf the answer to both these questions is ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, then you can use the\nimage exactly as you‚Äôve conceived it. If, however, either one of the\nanswers is ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, then you must move on to the second step:\n2. What other primary image do I have to use as a believability-bridge\nto connect what my prospect already believes with what I want him to\nbelieve when he \u0000nishes my ad? If he doesn‚Äôt believe that my product has\nthose desirable character traits, then I have to start with what he already\n\nbelieves. I have to use these images as a base, and build up to my desired\noverall image, as we discussed before.\nAnd, in addition, if my prospect believes that my product does\npossess these target-traits, but doesn‚Äôt believe that they relate to his life, as\nit exists in either the present or the future, then again I have to use a\nbridge-image. I have to insert a \u0000rst seen image that he can immediately\nidentify with, and use that acceptable identi\u0000cation as a hook to hang my\ntarget-image on to. For example, in the Marlboro ad, men who would\nnever identify themselves immediately with a yachting costume or an\nopera hat, accepted the image completely aÓÇùer it was introduced by the\nacceptable virility concept of the male model smoking the cigarette.\nIf you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm,\nyour ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across\nthat chasm‚Äîstarting on his side‚Äîthen he will let you lead him almost\nanywhere.\nOn Saleable Identi\u0000cations Springing From the\nPhysical Product Itself\nWe mentioned in Chapter 2 that for the purposes of preparing an\nadvertisement, every product can be considered to be two products.\nÓÅ¢ere is the functional product‚Äîwhat the product does for the consumer.\nAnd there is the physical product‚Äîwhat the consumer actually gets. In\ntapping mass desire, we put aside the physical product, and concentrated\non functional performances. Now, in searching for image-sources to\nbuild powerful identi\u0000cations, we re-examine the physical product itself.\nÓÅ¢e physical product can be broken down into three separate areas:\n1. Its appearance;\n2. Its components and structure; and\n3. ÓÅ¢e technical background from which it emerged\nEach one of these areas has image potential. In each one of them you\nmay \u0000nd strong primary images that already exist. Or in each one of\nthem you may be able to graÓÇù on related images that will greatly increase\nthe sales of your product.\nFor example, the appearance of your product. As you receive it, that\nproduct‚Äôs appearance is probably determined by function. Let‚Äôs say that\nthe product is mechanical, like a car. In this case, its appearance will be a\ncombination of what it has to do (roll on a highway, carry six people,\n\nshelter them against wind and rain, etc.), and the cheapest practical way\nof doing it. Out of this combination of performance and economy comes\nthe raw shell of your car‚Äîits basic functional appearance. It is at this\npoint that you start to build in the images.\nYou do this in two ways. First, you exploit the dramatic primary\nimages that already exist in the extreme forms of your product. For cars,\nfor instance, you borrow from the glamour cars‚Äîthe severe streamlining\nand stabilizing \u0000n of the racing car; the hub caps and wheel wells of the\nsports car; the exhaust ports and roof line of the custom car. And you\nblend their feeling of excitement and power and distinction into the\nfamily sedan.\nBut this is only the \u0000rst step. Once you have exploited the already-\nexisting primary images in your product‚Äîif there are any‚Äîyou then\nbegin to weave in other images that have absolutely nothing to do with\nthe necessary physical structure of your product. And you alter the\nappearance of your product to accommodate and express these images.\nFor example, many products are chemical rather than mechanical.\nÓÅ¢ey are liquids, powders, sprays, granulates, etc. ÓÅ¢erefore their physical\nappearance, to the manufacturer, is completely arbitrary. Outside of the\nneed to hold them together and shield them against wear, their physical\npackage can take any shape you wish.\nHere, of course, there are no primary images arising from functional\nappearance at all. All the images that you wish to shape into your package\nmust be borrowed. And where do you borrow them from? From the\nbackground of your product. Or from its components. Or from the values\nof society as a whole.\nFor example, the product‚Äôs background:\nOne of the most brilliant packaging concepts in years was Johnson &\nJohnson‚Äôs Micrin. Here was a mouth wash‚Äîa liquid‚Äîsold in drug stores\nand supermarkets‚Äîwhose effectiveness far exceeded any similar product\never sold before. How were they to convey that effectiveness to the\nconsumer at a glance?\nÓÅ¢ey simply took the physical shape of glass containers that are found\nonly in doctors‚Äô offices and operating rooms, and transcribed that exact\nshape onto an over-the-counter product. Use this shape to house an ice-\nblue liquid, that in itself suggests medical cleanliness, and you have a\nproduct that says instantly, ‚ÄúÓÅ¢is is doctor‚Äôs-liquid. ÓÅ¢is is medicine. ÓÅ¢is\nworks.‚Äù\n\nHere the background of the product is symbolized in the product‚Äôs\ncontainer. So effectively that the container itself becomes the \u0000nest\nimage-illustration that the agency could use in creating their ad. Where\nthe background of your product contains elements that inspire excitement,\ndrama, quality or believability to your prospect, then those elements should\nbe expressed either in the product itself, or in its package, or in its ad.\nÓÅ¢e same hypothesis holds true for the components that make up\nyour product. If your product has electronic components, for example, it\nshould have an electronic \u0000avor to both its appearance and its\nadvertising. Show the radar installations, guided missiles, jet aircraÓÇù that\nuse the same parts. Life for the average man is dull, completely lacking in\nadventure. Offer to let him participate in the frontier explorations of our\nworld, and you have welded a tremendously potent appeal onto your\nproduct.\n\n4\n-\nTHE THIRD TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY:\nGRADUALIZATION\nHow to Make Your Prospect Believe\nYour Claims Before You State ÓÅ¢em\nAs we have learned before, for the purpose of persuasion, the human\nmind may be divided into three dimensions‚Äîthree great rivers of\nemotional force that determine the reaction to your ad, and therefore its\nsuccess or failure.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst of these dimensions is Desire‚Äîwant, yearning, motivation‚Äî\nwith speci\u0000c goals and/or cures in mind‚Äîwith the prospect begging to\nbe shown how to obtain them. It is the copy writer‚Äôs job to make sure the\npath to these goals goes through the product‚Äîand to make sure that the\nprospect can visualize every drop of satisfaction that their achievement\nwill give him.\nÓÅ¢e second dimension is Identi\u0000cation‚Äîthe need for expression and\nrecognition‚Äîunformulated, unspoken, at least partially unconscious‚Äî\nsearching for symbols, de\u0000nitions and embodiments. It is the copy\nwriter‚Äôs job to crystallize these self-de\u0000nitions and embody them in his\nproduct‚Äîso that the product may be used, not only as a source of\nphysical satisfaction, but also as a symbolic extension of the personality\nof the prospect for whom it is intended.\nUntil now, this book has been concerned with these \u0000rst two\ndimensions. ÓÅ¢ey have determined the selection of our headline and our\nillustration, and most of the content of our ad.\nBut‚Äîimportant as they are‚Äîdesire and identi\u0000cation alone are never\nenough. By themselves, they can never produce the full reaction the copy\nwriter must have if he is to achieve the maximum success with his\nproduct. No matter how intense the desire, no matter how demanding the\nneed to identify, both these reactions must be fused with a third great\nemotional force‚ÄîBelief‚Äîbefore they can produce the \u0000nal\noverwhelming determinant of action‚ÄîAbsolute Conviction.\nIt is this fusion of desire and belief‚Äîthis conviction‚Äîthis certainty‚Äî\nthis feeling in the prospect of being right in his choice‚Äîof being assured of\nwhat he has been promised‚Äîthat the copy writer seeks as his ultimate goal.\n\nAnd it is to this third dimension of the human mind‚Äîthe Belief that\nproduces this certainty‚Äîthat we now turn.\nWhat Exactly Is Belief?\nIt is perhaps the most complex fusion of thought and emotion in the\nhuman mind. It is, \u0000rst of all, your prospect‚Äôs mental picture of the world\nhe lives in‚Äîwhat facts make it up, how it works, in what direction its\ntruths and values lie.\nBut these accepted facts, truths, values and opinions are only the raw\nmaterial of belief. Even more important is the vast amount of emotional\nsecurity he derives from these beliefs. It is the wonderful feeling of comfort\nand reassurance of living in a world that has meaning, where there are\nanswers to be had, where somehow the facts all \u0000t. A world that he can\nunderstand and depend on, that he can predict, that will stay together\nand not blow up in his face tomorrow morning or the morning aÓÇùer that.\nDo not be misled for even a moment. ÓÅ¢e need to believe‚Äîand the\nneed for secure beliefs‚Äîis just as powerful an emotional force as the\nstrongest desire for physical satisfaction, or the most urgent search for\nexpression.\nMost adults have done their basic learning of these beliefs when they\nwere children. At that time, and in that dependent stage of their lives,\nthey laid down the primary channels of belief that their minds would\nfollow for the rest of their days. ÓÅ¢ey were forced to do this, in order to\nunderstand the world, to gain its approval, to trust and master it, and to\ndevelop themselves into self-sustaining adults.\nTo ask them to shatter even one of these already-established lines of\nbelief‚Äîto plunge into uncertainty again‚Äîto be forced to reassemble their\nbeliefs in new, untested ways‚Äîis to ask them to become children again.\nAnd‚Äîunless they are ‚Äúfrightened beyond belief,‚Äù unless their entire\nconceptual world has crumbled around them‚Äîthey simply will not do it.\nÓÅ¢e basic rule of belief, then, can simply be stated as this:\nIf you violate your prospect‚Äôs established beliefs in the slightest degree\n‚Äîeither in content or direction‚Äîthen nothing you promise him, no\nmatter how appealing, can save your ad.\nBut, on the other hand, and even more important: If you can channel\nthe tremendous force of his belief‚Äîeither in content or direction‚Äî\nbehind only one claim, no matter how small, then that one fully-believed\n\nclaim will sell more goods than all the half-questioned promises your\ncompetitors can write for all the rest of their days. ÓÅ¢is channeling of\nbelief is so powerful that, if properly directed, it will even support\notherwise-absurd claims.\nIt is simply a question of whether you are going to paddle upstream or\ndown. Whether you are going to work against the tide of established\nbelief, or with it.\nAs far as advertising is concerned, then, belief is immutable. It cannot\nbe changed. It must be complied with at every step. Every one of the\nstatements you make in your ad must \u0000t in with your prospects version of\n‚Äúthe facts‚Äù at that precise moment. It is not the function of your ad to\nchange those facts.\nBut it is its function‚Äîand one of its great sources of strength‚Äîto\nextend them. To build a bridge of belief between those facts as they exist in\nyour prospect‚Äôs mind today‚Äîand the ultimate facts your prospect must\nbelieve if he is to accept your claims.\nÓÅ¢is process of starting with the facts that your prospect is already\nwilling to accept, and leading him logically and comfortably through a\ngradual succession of more and more remote facts‚Äîeach of which he has\nbeen prepared in turn to accept‚Äîis called Gradualization. It is the third\nProcess of Persuasion.\nMind you, this process of Gradualization has nothing to do with the\noffering of proof, or reason-why explanations, or testimonials or\ndocumentation. Each of these mechanisms of belief adds to the power of\nyour ad, and we will explore each of them in turn in the chapters that\nfollow.\nIn Chapter 11, we will discuss the verbal demonstration that your\nproduct does what you claim‚ÄîMechanization.\nIn Chapter 12, we will discuss the destruction of alternate ways of\nsatisfying that same desire‚ÄîConcentration.\nIn Chapter 14, we will discuss the offering of authorities and proof,\nthe reassurance that your prospect has made a wise choice‚ÄîVeri\u0000cation.\nAll these devices build belief. But by far the most fundamental of all\n‚Äîthough the most inconspicuous‚Äîis Gradualization. For Gradualization\ndetermines‚Äînot the content of your ad‚Äîbut its structure, its architecture,\nthe way you build it.\nWe have already seen that it is the dominating desire of your prospect\nthat determines the content of your ad. It is his longings for identi\u0000cation\n\nand self-expression that, in most cases, determine your illustrations.\nBut it is the facts that he believes in and accepts, and the way that he\npasses that acceptance along from one fact to another, that determines\nthat ad‚Äôs development‚Äîthe arrangement of your claims and your images\nand your proofs, so that there is a step-by-step strengthening‚Äînot only\nof your prospect‚Äôs desire‚Äîbut of his conviction that the satisfaction of\nthat desire will come true through your product.\nÓÅ¢e Architecture of Belief\nIn essence, then, the theory of Gradualization is based upon this fact:\nÓÅ¢at every claim, every image, every proof in your ad has two\nseparate sources of strength‚Äî\n1. ÓÅ¢e content of that statement itself; and\n2. ÓÅ¢e preparation you have made for that statement‚Äîeither by\nrecognizing that preparation as already existing in your prospect‚Äôs mind,\nor by deliberately laying the groundwork for that statement in the\npreceding portion of the ad itself.\nAnd, because of this fact, we can strengthen the power of each of\nthese statements in two separate ways‚Äî\n1. By increasing the intensity of its content‚Äîby making greater\npromises, by portraying more dramatic images, by offering more\ncompelling proof; and/or\n2. By changing the place or position or sequence in which that\nstatement occurs in the ad‚Äîby strengthening the ground-work for belief\nin that statement by the material which precedes it‚Äîand therefore\nincreasing the intensity of belief given to it‚Äîthe immediate acceptance of\nits content, without question, when the prospect encounters it in your ad.\nMake no mistake, it is this acceptance that we are looking for. Effective\nadvertising, like effective literature, is built‚Äînot of words‚Äîbut of\nreactions. We put down on paper an architecture of words. If these words\nare effective, they evoke, in turn, an architecture of reactions in our\nprospect‚Äôs mind. We are creating a stream of acceptances, with a de\u0000nite\nsequence and content and direction, and, if we are successful, with a\nde\u0000nite goal‚Äîthe absolute conviction in your prospects mind that he\nmust have your product.\nÓÅ¢is is the essence of building your ad. We now turn to the\ntechniques of its accomplishment.\n\nA New De\u0000nition of Awareness\nWe now know that Gradualization is the art of starting your ad with a\nstatement that will be immediately and entirely accepted, and then\nbuilding a chain of subsequent acceptances upon this \u0000rst statement. ÓÅ¢e\npurpose of this chain of acceptances is to lead your reader to a goal\nconclusion, which he will then accept, but which he would not as readily\nor as thoroughly have accepted without the preliminary statements.\nÓÅ¢is quest for acceptance begins, of course, with your headline. ÓÅ¢is\nall-important \u0000rst statement that you make‚Äîthis meeting place between\nyour story and your prospect‚Äîmust not only be capable of awakening\ninterest and desire, but of being accepted at the very \u0000rst glance as being\ntrue.\nInterest and believability‚Äîthese are the two requirements that\ndetermine your headline. We have already discussed these requirements\nin Chapter 2, on the State of Awareness of our market.\nWe can now rede\u0000ne this State of Awareness as readiness to accept.\nAnd we can now say‚Äîespecially in the FiÓÇùh Stage of Awareness‚Äîthat the\neffectiveness of your headline is as much determined by the willingness of\nyour audience to believe what it says, as it is by the promises it makes.\nÓÅ¢is is the reason that you cannot always use the most powerful claim\nin your headline. Or even the very problem that your product solves.\nBecause without supporting evidence already existing in the mind of\nyour prospect to prepare him for that headline claim, he just won‚Äôt believe\nit. Either he‚Äôll believe that it‚Äôs exaggerated or false, or he just won‚Äôt believe\nit applies to him. In either case, too many of your prospects turn away\nwithout reading on, and your ad fails.\nÓÅ¢is fact‚Äîthat your most powerful claim does not always make your\nmost powerful headline‚Äîis a paradox that many copy writers still cannot\naccept. Mail order advertisers, however, have a simple way of proving it.\nWhen a power-claim headline doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîfor reasons either of\nAwareness or Sophistication‚Äîthey immediately split it against a second\nhead, with far fewer claims in it, but far more likely to be believed. ÓÅ¢en\nthey build a belief-bridge from this second headline, to the same exact\nclaims they had featured in the \u0000rst, but now anticipated by careful\npreparation every step along the way.\nA Detailed Example\n\nLet us take such an ad‚Äîthat we have already glanced at in Chapter 2\n‚Äîand break down its structure step by step. What we are looking for here\nis not content, nor promises, nor claims; but the way these promises and\nclaims are arranged in the ad, to help each one of them gain full acceptance\nwhen it is encountered in turn by the prospect.\nÓÅ¢is ad was written in 1951. Its purpose was to sell a Television\nRepair Manual. ÓÅ¢eoretically, every TV owner who was having any\ntrouble with his set (and almost all of them were at that time) was a\nprospect. But, before the prospect could be turned into a customer, he\nhad to believe two things:\n1. ÓÅ¢at he could save money by making his own TV repairs; and\n2. ÓÅ¢at he was capable of making them. Both these statements were\nmatters of fact. ÓÅ¢e average TV owner certainly could save money if he\nhad made his own repairs; and about 80% of those repairs were simple\nenough for him to make himself.\nBut the overwhelming majority of prospects simply didn‚Äôt realize\nthese facts. Most of them thought of themselves as non-handymen, even\nin relation to far simpler devices than a television set. And, in 1951, the\nTV set was considered a complicated mechanical monster, far beyond\ntheir poor powers to understand let alone correct.\nÓÅ¢ese two factors blocked the use of the obvious power-claim\nheadline for this product. Such a headline was written and tested‚Äî‚ÄúSave\nup to $100 a Year on Your TV Repairs!‚Äù‚Äîbut it failed to make a pro\u0000t.\nÓÅ¢e obvious was unsuccessful. Power alone could not move the product.\nTwo tasks faced the copy writer in revising this ad. First, he had to\nreach all his prospects in this market, and not just those among them\nwho considered themselves handymen. And second, he had to convince\nall these non-handymen prospects that their sets weren‚Äôt really such\nfragile, complicated monsters aÓÇùer all, and that they themselves could\neasily correct most troubles that arose.\nOnce these two statements were believed by the prospect and only\nthen‚Äîcould the previous headline claim of ‚ÄúSave up to $100 a year on\nyour TV repairs‚Äù be brought in at full power. Let us see, acceptance by\nacceptance, how this new ad built to that point:\nÓÅ¢e headline, \u0000rst of all, would have to be a general statement,\ncrystallizing and exploiting the universal resentment against the high TV\nrepair bills, the $60-a-year TV service contracts that were then in\nexistence, and the outright thievery that occurred in only a small fraction\n\nof the TV repair shops, but that had stigmatized the entire industry. From\nthere‚Äîfrom this universally-accepted resentment‚Äîthe ad could then\nbuild toward the two goal conclusions listed above. Let us see how this\nwas done, statement by statement.\nHere is the new headline:\n‚ÄúWHY HAVEN‚ÄôT TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?‚Äù\nNo claim. No promise‚Äîexcept that of disclosure. But here is an\nimplication of foul play, which echoed the existing suspicion in the TV\nowner himself. Here is a crystallization and outright expression that the\naverage owner felt toward being taken. Facts have been withheld. ÓÅ¢is is\nsomething he can agree with! ÓÅ¢us, having achieved its \u0000rst acceptance\nby its suspicion-headline, the ad reinforces that effect by an inclusion-\nquestion. It asks a questions which, in form, seems to limit the market;\nbut which, in content, actually assures the correct answer by the\noverwhelming majority of it:\n‚ÄúWas your set purchased after the spring of 1947?‚Äù\n95% of television owners would answer Yes. ÓÅ¢us the ad has built two\nacceptances in its \u0000rst two sentences. It has started a Habit of Agreement\nin its reader. It now exploits that agreement by making its \u0000rst de\u0000nite\npromise in the third sentence:\n‚ÄúThen here is the full, uncensored story of how you can\navoid those $15-$20 repair bills‚Äîavoid those $30-$60 a\nyear service fees‚Äîand still get the perfect, movie-clear\npictures you‚Äôve dreamed about!‚Äù\nHow Belief Was Built Into the Opening\nÓÅ¢is is the ad‚Äôs \u0000rst claim. Its content alone is extremely powerful. But\nthat powerful content‚Äîwhich otherwise might drive many readers away\nas being just too fantastic to be believed‚Äîhas been given extra belief‚Äî\nhas been loaned, as it were, extra belief‚Äînot only by the \u0000rst two\nsentences that preceded it‚Äîbut by these deliberate constructions in the\nstatement itself:\n1. By the grammatical construction, ‚ÄúWas your‚Ä¶‚Äù in the second\nsentence, and ‚ÄúÓÇªen ‚Ä¶‚Äù in the third which by its very form generates\n\nbelief. It does this by implying exclusion. It says that the promise will\ncome true only in certain cases; that it will only work for television sets\npurchased aÓÇùer 1947; that the ad cannot make this promise for sets\npurchased earlier. ÓÅ¢us it adds credence to whatever statement follows it.\nYou can feel this added believability yourself by taking out the lead-word\n‚ÄúÓÅ¢en‚Äù from the sentence and reading it again. Immediately, it loses half\nits force‚Äîforce added to the content of the statement by the\ngrammatical-bridge tying it in to the \u0000rst two acceptances.\n2. ÓÅ¢e second attempt at adding believability is by the descriptive\nnature of the promise. It is not only a promise of reward (the money\nsaved), but a catalog of almost-universal symptoms (repair bills and\nservice fees). Since the overwhelming majority of set owners are suffering\nfrom these problems, their descriptions evoke two more ‚ÄúYes‚ÄîI have\nthem‚Äù reactions from the reader, and carry these reactions over to the\nsave-money claims that immediately follow them. If these descriptions\nwere eliminated, the money-saving claims would be much weaker: ‚ÄúThen\nhere is the full, uncensored story of how you can save $15-$20‚Äîsave\n$30-$60‚Äîsave $90-$100 on your TV set‚Äîand still get the perfect,\nmovie-clear pictures you‚Äôve dreamed about!‚Äù\n3. And \u0000nally, even though the causes of the set owner‚Äôs problems are\nspeci\u0000cally described, the cures for them are deliberately leÓÇù ambiguous.\nÓÅ¢e fact that they will save otherwise wasted money, that they will get\nimproved reception, is included‚Äîhow they will do this is not. ÓÅ¢e\nmechanism by which these goals will be accomplished is leÓÇù out. It is leÓÇù\nout because the reader has not yet been prepared for it. If he were to\nlearn, at this moment in the ad, that he had to make repairs on his set to\nsave this money, the average reader would turn the page. So he is given\nspeci\u0000c symptoms, that he will agree he has, and speci\u0000c savings by\neliminating them, that are certainly logical to expect. He may or may not\naccept all these three claims in the sentence completely; but the strength\nof their promise, the two or three or four acceptances that he has already\ngiven, and the implied disclosures still remaining in the body of the ad,\nshould be enough to carry him on, to this next paragraph:\n‚ÄúHow many times this week have you had to get up to\nfix a jumpy TV picture? ‚Ä¶ How many times have you had\nto put up with ghosts? ‚Ä¶ How many times‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHere again is reinforcement of belief‚Äîthe description of universal\nsymptoms‚Äîthe coaxing out of a stream of agreements. ‚ÄúYes ‚Ä¶ Yes ‚Ä¶\nYes‚Äù‚Äîhe must answer if he has had trouble with his set. A habit of\nacceptance is being built inside him. Trust is being formed, layer by layer\n‚Äîas each question poses a test, and each yes answer proves to the reader\nthat the ad is talking about him.\nAlready the ad is beginning to weave its pattern of promise and belief\nand then promise again. Now, with as many as seven or eight agreements\nbehind it to establish a \u0000rm foundation of belief, the ad moves on to its\nnext great promise:\n‚Äú90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll of these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to\nyou at the moment they happened‚Äîbut here is the real\ntragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you\nnow have in your front room ‚Ä¶ has been playing in\nmanufacturer‚Äôs test rooms for months‚Äîand playing\nperfectly!‚Äù\nGoal Conclusions\nÓÅ¢e ad is now laying the basis for the \u0000rst of its two goal conclusions\n‚Äîthat TV sets are not fragile‚Äîthat they have amazing endurance if they\nare properly cared for. Only when the reader accepts this fact, can the ad\ngo on to its second conclusion‚Äîthat whatever minor breakdowns do\noccur can be easily handled by the owner himself.\nBut the ad is still \u0000ve paragraphs away from any mention of the\nowner touching his set. First it must establish the dependability of the set;\nand it does this by two methods. At the start, in the following two\nparagraphs, it gives graphic descriptions of the manufacturer‚Äôs own tests\nused to establish this dependability:\n‚ÄúThese sets have been subjected to ‚ÄòBreakdown Tests‚Äô\nthat would seem incredible to the average owner. They\nhave been turned on for 24 hours a day‚Äî7 days a week‚Äî4\nweeks a month. Some of these sets have been naming\nwithout a moment‚Äôs pause for as much as 17 months.\n‚ÄúThese sets have been tested against almost every\nconceivable type of viewing hazard‚Ä¶ up to 120 miles away\n\nfrom the station ‚Ä¶ against the interference of an entire\nwarehouse of electrical appliances ‚Ä¶ in special, steel-\nribbed buildings, which ordinarily would produce several\ndistinct ghosts.\n‚ÄúAnd in almost every one of these cases, these sets\nhave produced perfect, movie-clear pictures‚Äîwithout\nmajor breakdowns‚Äîfor as much as one full year! Here are\nsome of the reasons why:‚Äù\nÓÅ¢en, when the reader has fully visualized the impact of these test\nreports, the ad now turns to expert authority and logical construction to\nreinforce this belief. Notice in the next few paragraphs how the ad picks\nup the already-accepted condition. ‚ÄúIf your set were properly cared for, as\nthese sets were ‚Ä¶‚Äù, and uses that now-established condition to prove the\nseries of statements that follow it:\nWHAT TV EXPERTS HAVE LEARNED\nABOUT YOUR SET!\n‚ÄúIf your set were properly cared for‚Äîas these sets were\ncared for in these tests‚Äîit need break down only once\nduring the entire year! In other words, you may actually\nhave to call in a repairman only once during the entire\nyear. You can save the $30-$60 service fees you are now\npaying‚Äîand you can save most of the SERIOUS repair\nbills.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIf your set was properly cared for, it can actually give\nyou perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days a\nyear. It can give you this perfect reception without special\nelectronic equipment‚Äîwithout the help of a repairman‚Äî\nup to 100 miles away from your station.‚Äù\nNotice that in these two paragraphs, the ad returns to the claims\nmade in the third sentence‚Äîrepeats them almost word for word‚Äîand\nthen gives logical proof, in logical form, for each of them. As we have\npointed out before, these claims‚Äî‚Äúyou can avoid those $15-$20 repair\nbills‚Äîavoid those $30-$60 a year service fees‚Äîand still get the perfect,\nmovie-clear picture you‚Äôve dreamed about!‚Äù‚Äîwere stated in the third\nsentence without supporting proof at that time; but with strong\n\nimplication‚Äî‚ÄúHere is the full, uncensored story‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äîthat such proof would\nfollow.\nÓÅ¢at proof is now submitted, in an extremely formal and logical\nstructure. ÓÅ¢us the ad again weaves proof into promise‚Äîrepeating\nprevious claims in a new context of full documentation, where it could\nonly suggest that they would be proven before.\nNotice also that this logical proof‚Äî‚ÄúIf your set were cared for‚Ä¶ it need\nbreak down only once a year‚Ä¶ you need call a repairman only once a\nyear‚Ä¶ you save the service fees and most repair bills.‚Äù‚Äîis, in itself, solidly\ngrounded in the test-proof presented in the paragraphs before it‚Äî‚Äúbeing\nsubjected to break-down tests ‚Ä¶ against almost every type of viewing\nhazard ‚Ä¶ and produced perfect pictures, without breakdowns, for as much\nas one full year.‚Äù ÓÅ¢us a chain of proof upon proof is constructed‚Äîeach\nnew statement repeating the heart of the proof before it.\nÓÅ¢us the ad has now proved‚Äîby using the Mechanism of\nIntensi\u0000cation‚Äîby repeating the same theme-content seven different\ntimes in seven different ways‚Äîthat your TV set is dependable.\nÓÅ¢e Ultimate Objective\nÓÅ¢is was the \u0000rst goal-conclusion. At this point the reader is\nconvinced that it is true. ÓÅ¢e ad is now ready to go on to prove the second\ngoal conclusion: that the owner can correct minor breakdowns himself.\nIt begins this proof in the very next paragraph, in this way:\n‚ÄúAnd, most important, these experts have discovered\nthat you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in\norder to coax this performance out of your set! Here‚Äôs\nwhy:‚Äù\nNotice that it is in this paragraph that the entirely-new (to the reader)\nassumption‚Äîthat you can \u0000x your own minor breakdowns‚Äîis \u0000rst\nintroduced. Yet its novelty is deliberately concealed; it is presented as\nthough it were simply another rephrasing of the by-now already accepted\ndependability conclusion. ÓÅ¢ere is therefore no break in the logical \u0000ow\nof proof. Acceptance is built into this entirely new statement in these four\ndifferent ways:\n1. By paragraph parallelism. By framing the statement as the last of a\nseries of similar paragraphs‚Äîall the others of which have already been\n\naccepted‚Äîinstead of physically setting it off as a new point with its own\nsub head and a different construction, as the reader would ordinarily\nexpect.\n2. By the lead word, ‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù a tie-in phrase, which indicates that the\nsentence accompanying it is the same as those that have gone before.\n3. By immediately following ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù by a second tie-in phrase, ‚Äúmost\nimportant,‚Äù which again implies that the remainder of the statement is\npart of the series that has gone before.\n4. And \u0000nally, by repeating the phrase, ‚Äúthese experts have\ndiscovered,‚Äù which echoes the identifying subhead at the beginning of the\nseries, and carries on the acceptance-momentum of the series as a whole.\nAll these deliberate constructions combine to give this short, but vital,\ntransitional paragraph the acceptance, and therefore the believability, of\nall the careful planning that has gone before it. ÓÅ¢ey allow the reader to\nmake what otherwise might be a jarring transition from already-\nestablished proof to an entirely new promise with a minimum of effort.\nNow the ad builds its \u0000nal step‚Äîshowing that the only repairs that\nthe average owner will have to make are actually minor external\nadjustments on his set. Notice how it integrates this new extension of its\nprevious thought into what has gone before by starting with the phrase,\nonce again, ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ese experts have discovered‚Ä¶‚Äù\nHere are the next three paragraphs:\nFIVE MINUTES A WEEK FOR PERFECT\nRECEPTION.\n‚ÄúThese TV experts have discovered that your TV set is\na great deal like your body in this respect‚Äîthat it gives\nyou warning signals before it has a major breakdown. For\ninstance, after your set was installed, it probably played\nperfectly for the first week. But then it began to suffer\nfrom the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other\nelectrical appliances in your home. The picture might\nsuddenly begin to flop over or flicker‚Äîlines may appear on\nyour screen.\n‚ÄúNow‚Äîand this is important‚Äîif you had the\nknowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on\nthe outside controls of your set, then you could correct\nthose symptoms, you could keep that set playing\n\nperfectly, and you could prevent major breakdowns in\nexactly the same way they were prevented in these\nmanufacturers‚Äô tests.\n‚ÄúIf you do not have this knowledge ‚Ä¶ if you do not\nmake these adjustments, then your set will weaken, you\nwill get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call\na repairman.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢e second goal-conclusion of the ad has now been reached. At this\nstage of the copy, the reader now knows:\n1. ÓÅ¢at his set is dependable enough to avoid major breakdowns\nduring by far the greatest majority of the time he will play it; and\n2. ÓÅ¢at if he obtains the proper knowledge, he can correct minor\nbreakdowns himself, and help prevent the gradual formation of major\nbreakdowns, by making a few simple adjustments to the outside controls\nof his set.\nÓÅ¢erefore, the stage has now been set for the \u0000nal conclusion‚Äîthe\npay-off conclusion‚Äîa conclusion with all the inevitable logical force of a\nsyllogism‚Äîthat:\n3. ÓÅ¢e owner should obtain this knowledge‚Äîmake these minor\nadjustments himself‚Äîand therefore save the money he is paying today\nfor service contracts, and save by far the greatest majority of the money\nhe is paying for repair bills.\nHere is how this \u0000nal conclusion is phrased by the copy:\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as simple as that. You pay a repairman‚Äînot for his\nwork‚Äîbut for his knowledge. If you had that knowledge\nyourself‚Äîthen you would not have to pay him at all.‚Äù\nA Restatement of Our Basic ÓÅ¢eory\nWe have taken a great deal of space to analyze, in exact detail, one ad,\nand the structure of believability that underlies the effectiveness of its\nclaims.\nWe have done this for two reasons:\n1. To show how the goal-conclusion‚Äîthe introduction of the product\nclaim itself‚Äîmay be made far more effective if it is delayed till the\nprospect has been prepared to accept it. And\n\n2. To show how this full acceptance‚Äîthis willingness to believe\nwithout question-can gradually be built up, layer by layer agreement by\nagreement, by use of the proper structure.\nLet us now state formally some of the rules we have discovered in this\nanalysis, and some of the devices you can use time aÓÇùer time, to create\nthe maximum structural believability for each of your advertisements.\nHere are the basic principles:\nGradualization is the art of stating a claim in such a way that it will\nreceive the greatest possible acceptance and/or believability from your\nprospect.\nBelief ultimately depends upon structure. Just as desire depends upon\npromise, so belief in that promise depends upon the amount of\npreparation that promise has been given before your reader is asked to\naccept it.\nOne fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power oÓÇùen\npartially-believed promises. Most copy writers try to strengthen ads by\npiling promise upon promise. What they usually get for their troubles is\ngreater sales resistance from their prospects and trouble from the ETC.\nÓÅ¢ey could far better invest the same time in strengthening the\nbelievability-structure of the original justi\u0000able promise.\nNow, how do you strengthen this believability-structure? What are\nthe devices you can choose from to add believability to any promise, in\nany ad?\nHere are at least a few of them. Once you get the feel of using them,\nyou‚Äôll probably develop a whole armory of your own.\n1. ÓÅ¢e Inclusion Question\nDesigned to permit immediate identi\u0000cation with your story. To show\nthe prospect that you‚Äôre talking about him‚Äînot about someone else who\nwould answer No to the question. ÓÅ¢erefore, once he‚Äôs identi\u0000ed with the\nquestions‚Äîonce he‚Äôs made his \u0000rst agreements with you and placed\nhimself in the Yes-answer group‚Äîthen your recommendations will have\nspecial meaning for him.\nÓÅ¢is is perhaps the most direct way of building agreement at the\nbeginning of the ad. It‚Äôs used every day. For example, in this\nadvertisement‚Äîhighly successful‚Äîfor a book called ÓÇªe Art of\nSel\u0000shness:\n\nASK YOURSELF THESE NINE QUESTIONS\n1. Do you find it increasingly difficult to cope with the\nworld around you‚Ä¶\n2. Is your business or career a source of annoyance and\nfrustration‚Ä¶\n3. Are you tormented by inadequacies, fear and\nembarrassments in your sex life‚Ä¶\nAnd so on.\n2. Detailed Identi\u0000cation\nAnother device used at the beginning of the ad, to establish\nimmediate, and deep, agreement between the reader and the copy. Here,\ninstead of asking questions to set up your Yes-train, you detail symptoms\nor problems that are your prospect‚Äôs reasons for desiring your product.\nÓÅ¢us, again, your reader knows that you are talking about him‚Äîthat you\n‚Äúhave been there yourself ‚Äù‚Äîand therefore that your recommendations\nwill help answer these problems, his problems, that you have catalogued\nso well.\nFor example, in this ad for a course to improve the prospect‚Äôs child‚Äôs\ngrades in school:\nLet me explain. I don‚Äôt care whether your child is six\nyears old or twenty‚Äîboy or girl‚Äîin grade school high\nschool or college. It makes no difference how badly that\nchild is doing in school today‚Äîhow difficult it is for him to\nconcentrate ‚Ä¶ how poor his memory may be ‚Ä¶ how much\na prisoner he is of crippling mental habits ‚Ä¶ how terrified\nhe may be of mathematics, or grammar, or social studies,\nor even the hardest science course.\nOf course, here‚Äîas in the Inclusion-Question‚Äîyour copy must be\naccurate. You must know enough about the reader‚Äôs problems to make\nevery word you write ring true. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll shatter your\nbelievability-net, and he‚Äôll simply turn the page.\nSo‚Äîbefore you write‚Äîresearch. Learn to know your customer. ÓÅ¢is\nis always the essential \u0000rst step, in any kind of copy.\n\n3. Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs\nAgain, used at the beginning of the ad. And again used to prepare a\nfoundation for strong claim-statements that the reader might never\naccept raw. Here, you come bluntly out and say, ‚ÄúI know you think this is\ntrue; but I‚Äôm going to show YOU it‚Äôs false.‚Äù Best used, of course, in\nconjunction with strong authority strong enough to contradict present\n(unpleasant) beliefs, and get away with it.\nFor example, in an ad for cosmetics invented by a famous plastic\nsurgeon:\nFrom this moment on, forget everything you have ever\nheard or read about what age ‚Äúmust do‚Äù to your\nappearance. Forget anything you have ever believed\nabout how ‚Äúold‚Äù you must look at thirty ‚Ä¶ forty ‚Ä¶ fifty ‚Ä¶\nor even sixty.\nHere you are not looking for agreement as much as you are for a\nloosening of previous beliefs. You are saying that the old limitations are\npassing, and your next paragraph should be your \u0000rst introduction of\nyour positive claims, in somewhat the same way that this ad goes on:\nBecause‚Äîstarting with this moment‚Äîyou are about to\nenter into a new world of beauty! A world where ordinary\nfruits are transformed into anti-wrinkle cosmetics. Where\na‚Ä¶\nAnd so on.\n4. ÓÅ¢e Language of Logic\nSo far, the devices we have discussed have been used to build belief at\nthe beginning of your ad‚Äîto serve in the crucial transition from your\nheadline to the stream of intensi\u0000ed promises that you are going to use to\nclose the sale.\nWe have discussed the process of intensifying desire in Chapter 7. We\nnow turn to the simultaneous, and equally important, task of maintaining\nbelief in each new statement as you present it.\nHere again, your objective is to build belief at the same exact time\nthat you build desire. To do this, you interlace each new promise with\n\nlanguage-signals that show that it logically follows from everything that has\nbeen proved before. And that it therefore can be believed without hesitation.\nWhat are these language-signals? ÓÅ¢ey are, of course, the vocabulary\nof logic. ÓÅ¢ey are the words we use when we reason: when we argue;\nwhen we prove our point in any discussion, and force others to agree with\nus that we are right.\nÓÅ¢ey are among the most powerful words in the English language‚Äî\nfor the very simple reason that they give the \u0000avor of conviction to the\npromises into which we weave them.\nÓÅ¢ese words have been used for centuries in court, in politics, in\nscience‚Äîeven in that most-loved form of American \u0000ction, detective\nstories‚Äîto show others that proof has been offered, that reason has been\nused, that one statement logically and inevitably follows from another.\nÓÅ¢erefore, aÓÇùer centuries of conditioning, the words themselves‚Äî\nregardless of the content of the statements to which they are attached‚Äî\nnow carry conviction. ÓÅ¢erefore, they should be woven throughout your\nad, wherever they logically apply.\nFor example, let‚Äôs look at some individual lines, in a number of\ndifferent ads. Let‚Äôs see how each of these words (which I‚Äôll italicize) gives\na tone of reason and logic to those sentences in which they‚Äôre\nincorporated.\nFor example, in the famous Sherwin Cody ad:\nWhy do so many find themselves at a loss for words to\nexpress their meaning adequately? The reason for this\ndeficiency is clear‚Ä¶ Most persons do not write or speak\ngood English simply because they have never formed the\nhabit of doing so‚Ä¶\nOr, in this ad for a book on how to manage difficult people:\nTake, as an example, the man who habitually refuses\nto follow your instructions. There is a basic, underlying\nreason for this. Mr. Given shows you how to find that\nreason and then explains the means of correcting it. The\nwhole solution can be surprisingly easy once you have\nrealized the underlying causes‚Ä¶\nOr, for a book on learning how to learn:\n\n‚Ä¶ but simply by putting your LOCKED-UP LEARNING\nPOWERS to work‚Äîtoday‚Äîas easily and logically as this‚Ä¶\nAnd so on. ÓÅ¢ere are dozens of such phrases for you to use. Among\nthem are:\n‚ÄúThis has been proved by thousands‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúSound impossible? Not at all. It‚Äôs actually as simple‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd, most important of all, is the fact that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúTherefore ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis was, without a doubt, the most thorough‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúThey discovered‚Äîin case after case‚Äîthat‚Ä¶‚Äù\nÓÅ¢is, again, is the language of logic. It is a language equally as \u0000lled\nwith emotion as the language of desire. Interwoven into your promises,\nso subtly that the reader never even notices that it is there, it gives your\nclaims the invaluable air of conviction.\n5. Syllogistic ÓÅ¢inking\nNow we go from the language of logic to the mechanisms of logic.\nÓÅ¢is is the role that reason plays in your ad. ÓÅ¢is is the moment when you\nprove that your product works, through the mechanism of logical\nreasoning.\nFor example, in one of the most successful automotive accessory ads\nof all time, the copywriter wanted to prove that his spark plug was\nsuperior to the ordinary plug‚Äîeven though it costs twice as much. Since\nthe point of difference was simply that his plug delivered a larger spark,\nthe copywriter built up his case in this way:\nYour car runs because gasoline is fed into the cylinders\nwhere a spark causes it to fire. This action causes the gas\nto explode ‚Ä¶ this explosion pushes down the piston. Now\nhere is the important thing to you. The larger the spark is,\n\nthe more powerful the explosion. The more powerful the\nexplosion, the more power you get from your gasoline.\nPoor explosion means wasted gas‚Äîloss of power, poor\ngetaway, bad starting, a sluggish car.\nGood explosion means more miles per gallon‚Äîmore\nhorsepower; a more exciting car to drive!\nNotice the power of these three simple paragraphs. Power derived as\nmuch from their underlying formal structure as from their claims. One\nstatement inevitably leads into another. Every word is logical. ÓÅ¢ere is a\nconstant process of equation: spark to power, power to performance. Size\nequals power‚Äîand his plug delivers the largest size.\nSuch structure‚Äîand the copy based on such a structure‚Äîdevelops\nthe feeling of inevitability. ÓÅ¢e reader feels that the product must work.\nHe has not only been told it works; he has been shown proof that it works.\nSuch structure‚Äîthough hidden behind the words it clothes itself in‚Äî\nis actually a physical entity. You can seek it out of hundreds of ads, if you\nlook beneath the words themselves. You can trace it, codify it, and then\nrepeat it. Once learned, it becomes a powerful tool in selling hundreds of\nproducts.\nWe will explore these structures in more depth in the next two\nchapters‚Äîon Rede\u0000nition and Mechanization.\n6. Other Belief Forms\nOnce you grasp the fundamental idea that form‚Äîstructure‚Äî\ndetermines believability, then all sorts of opportunities open up to you.\nYou realize that simply by the arrangement of your claims, you can add to\ntheir believability.\nFor example:\nContingency Structures‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ then ‚Ä¶‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIs your‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶.‚Äù\nRepetition of Proof: Echoing‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ese experts found‚Ä¶ ÓÅ¢ese\nexperts found‚Ä¶ ÓÅ¢ese experts found‚Ä¶‚Äù\nPromise‚ÄîBelief‚ÄîPromise Variation. Where every sentence of\npromise is followed (ideally) with another of proof, or veri\u0000cation, or\ndocumentation. So that the reader never has the breathing space to\nquestion.\n\nParagraph Parallelism. Where the same word structure used in an\naccepted statement is then picked up exactly, and used to borrow\nacceptance for a fresh claim.\nÓÅ¢ere are many more, of course. Some are words, some are chains of\nreasoning, some are merely the physical arrangement of the copy on the\npage.\nAll have the same objective. To gain continued acceptance. To prevent\nrejection. To build conviction. Belief is the goal.\nNow let us look at some other methods of reinforcing it.\n\n5\n-\nTHE FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION\nHow to Remove Objections to Your Product\nTime and time again, you are going to have to sell a product that has\nbuilt-in handicaps. ÓÅ¢at‚Äîalong with its promises and its functions‚Äîalso\nhas certain aspects to it that actually repel the prospect.\nNo product, of course, is perfect. If only for the reason that he must\npay money for what you have to sell, your prospect starts with a basic\nminimum of resistance against buying your product. But this resistance is\nintensi\u0000ed by certain drawbacks in some products, oÓÇùen to the point\nwhere‚Äîunless you take de\u0000nite action in your ad to rede\u0000ne them‚Äîthese\ndrawbacks will actually kill your sale.\nLet us now look at the three general categories of drawback, and then\nat the three types of rede\u0000nition that eliminates them. First, of course,\nthere is the product that is (or that sounds) too complicated‚Äîtoo hard to\nuse.\nSecond, there is the product that is not important enough‚Äîwhose\nbasic appeal doesn‚Äôt have a statistically broad enough market.\nAnd third, there is the product that just costs too much. Its price is so\nmuch above the price of other products in its class that people simply\nturn away when it‚Äôs mentioned.\nIt‚Äôs amazing how many products fall into one or all of these categories.\nFortunately, the same mechanism‚Äîrede\u0000nition‚Äîhelps you deal with all\nthree.\nRede\u0000nition is the process of giving a new de\u0000nition to your product.\nIt says that the product is this rather than that. Its objective is to remove a\nroadblock to your sale‚Äîif possible, before the prospect even knows it\nexists.\nPerhaps the classic case of rede\u0000nition is that of Lifebuoy soap in the\nÓÅ¢irties. Lifebuoy was a good soap that did a good cleaning job. But it\nhad one overwhelming drawback‚Äîa horrible medicinal odor.\nSince the odor couldn‚Äôt be removed without removing the cleaning\npower, the problem became one of rede\u0000nition. Put simply: how do we\nchange this odor from a liability into an asset?\n\nÓÅ¢e answer, of course, was the famous B.O. campaign. ÓÅ¢e prospect‚Äôs\nattention was focused on the odor of his own body‚Äîan odor which he\nwas told would drive away people (and which does).\nHe was then told this odor must be eradicated‚Äînot with an ordinary\nsoap, which was not powerful enough to do the job but with a soap with\nthe odor-destroying power to make a longshoreman acceptable at a\nsociety ball. Lifebuoy was this super-powerful soap. And the\noverwhelming proof‚Äîthat you could smell the moment you opened the\nwrapper‚Äîwas the strong medicinal odor built into every cake.\nÓÅ¢is is the simplest, and oÓÇùen the most effective kind of rede\u0000nition.\nA simple concept-judo. A complete reversal. Turning a liability into an\nasset, with a single idea.\nWherever you can use this \u0000ip-\u0000op method, do so. But most\nproblems of rede\u0000nition are more complicated, and demand more\ncomplicated means of dealing with them‚Äîusing many of the devices we\nhave just examined in the process of Gradualization.\nLet us now turn to these devices, and see how they can present an\nentirely different image of the product to the prospect than you would\nhave imagined, had you not thought them through beforehand.\n1. Simpli\u0000cation\nOur \u0000rst category is the overcomplicated product‚Äîthe product that\nsounds too hard. To see how to replace this image with a more favorable\none, let‚Äôs look again at the Television Repair Book ad that we discussed in\nthe last chapter.\nAs you remember, the original ad for this product failed because it\npromised ‚ÄúDo your own TV repairs‚Äù in its headline. ÓÅ¢is was considered\ntoo difficult by the average set owner (even though the ad said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy,\nit‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs quick‚Äù in the next paragraph). ÓÅ¢erefore‚Äîsince the ad\nconfronted the prospect with the fact that he would have to make repairs\nbefore it made those repairs easy and simple and quick‚Äîhe simply turned\nthe page and tuned the ad out.\nÓÅ¢e second ad did not discuss repairs. It discussed breakdowns and\nexpenses. And, as we have seen, it spent its \u0000rst several paragraphs\nshowing that these breakdowns and expenses did not have to occur at all,\nif the sets were given the proper care. Up to this point, the ad has talked\nabout the prospect‚Äôs world‚Äîand compared it with a far more promising\n\nworld where expert care produces trouble-free TV viewing. Now the two\nworlds must be joined through the product.\nÓÅ¢is joining is called by the pitchman, ‚Äúthe turn.‚Äù It is a transition of\ngreat delicacy. It must be accomplished without a jar. In this ad, it begins\nin this paragraph:\nAnd most important, these experts have discovered\nthat you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in\norder to coax this performance out of your set! Here‚Äôs\nwhy‚Ä¶\nWe have already seen how the repetition (‚Ä¶these experts have\ndiscovered‚Ä¶) and the paragraph parallelism tie this statement into the\nstream of belief that has been built up before it. Now, however, we are\ngoing to look at this same paragraph from another point of view‚Äîto see\nhow it provides the \u0000rst step in eliminating any fear of making your own\nrepairs.\nNotice, of course, that the very fear of the average owner, that he is\nnot a repairman, is here brought out in the open‚Äîspeci\u0000cally stated‚Äîbut\nnow framed as a promise.\nNotice too that there is no mention of the word, ‚Äúrepair,‚Äù at this point.\nIt is still too early at this point. ÓÅ¢ough the average owner might be\nwilling to accept the idea that he could ‚Äúcoax‚Äù better performance out of\nhis set, it would still be too much to ask him to believe that he could make\nrepairs on that set at this point.\nÓÅ¢is leads to the \u0000nal step. ÓÇªe ad must now rede\u0000ne what the reader\nthinks of when he hears the word ‚Äúrepairs.‚Äù It must now lay a new\nfoundation of feet‚Äîshowing that almost all the repairs the owner will\nhave to make are actually only minor external adjustments.\nIt now proceeds to do this, in the following three paragraphs which\nwe have already studied in the last chapter, and which we will now look at\nagain to see the second process of persuasion-rede\u0000nition‚Äîwhich is also\noccurring in them.\nHere are the paragraphs again:\nFIVE MINUTES A WEEK FOR PERFECT\nRECEPTION.\n\nThese TV experts have discovered that your TV set is a\ngreat deal like your body in this respect‚Äîthat it gives you\nwarning signals before it has a major breakdown. For\ninstance, after your set was installed, it probably played\nperfectly for the first week. But then it began to suffer\nfrom the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other\nelectrical appliances in your home. The picture might\nsuddenly begin to flop over or flicker‚Äîlines may appear on\nyour screen.\nNow‚Äîand this is important‚Äîif you had the knowledge\nto quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside\ncontrols of your set, then you could correct those\nsymptoms, you could keep that set playing perfectly, and\nyou could prevent major breakdowns in exactly the same\nway they were prevented in these manufacturers‚Äô tests.\nIf you do not have this knowledge ‚Ä¶ if you do not\nmake these adjustments, then your set will weaken, you\nwill get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call\na repairman.\nNow, what occurs in these four paragraphs is actually a rede\u0000nition of\nthe term, ‚Äúrepairs‚Äù in the reader‚Äôs mind. ÓÅ¢is is done in three separate, but\nintegrated, ways:\n1. By immediately comparing the television set to the human body,\nand therefore minor maladjustments in the set to warning signals given\noff by the body before it becomes seriously ill.\nBy ‚Äúmaking this comparison, the copy relates the intricate, technical\nworking of a television set to something as commonplace and familiar as\nthe running nose that warns you of an approaching cold. Because of this\ncomparison, some of the mystery of the set is explained away; and the\nowner gains a new feeling of con\u0000dence in dealing with it himself, as\nsomething he understands.\nAnd, at the same time, this comparison distinguishes between the\nrelatively rare major breakdowns, and the far more frequent minor\nmaladjustments, which he can now treat himself as easily as he‚Äôd take a\ncold tablet to stop his running nose.\n2. ‚ÄòBy continuously describing these minor maladjustments as\n‚Äúwarning signals‚Äù and ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbreakdowns‚Äù or ‚Äúrepairs.‚Äù\n\nÓÇªis makes them sound easily corrected‚Äîbefore real trouble, which might\nrequire technical skill and complicated tools, can develop out of them.\n3. And \u0000nally, by stating outright that these minor adjustments can be\ncorrected by ‚Äúmaking a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of\nyour set.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢erefore, ‚Äúrepairs‚Äù are rede\u0000ned as ‚Äúadjustments.‚Äù Troubles on the\nTV screen are rede\u0000ned as ‚Äòwarning signals‚Äù or ‚Äúsymptoms.‚Äù And ‚Äúrepair\ncalls‚Äù or ‚Äúbreakdowns‚Äù are carefully segregated into the least-likely-to-\noccur 5% of all possible TV troubles.\nÓÅ¢erefore, with this rede\u0000nition in mind‚Äîwith this reorganization of\nfacts accomplished by the copy‚Äîthere is no longer any reason for the\naverage set owner not to make his own minor adjustments, rather than pay\na repairman to make them for him.\nÓÅ¢e objective has been accomplished. ÓÅ¢e ad can now go on to\nspeci\u0000cally state how much money the owner will save by making these\nadjustments‚Äîand where he can buy the book that tells him how.\nIn exactly the same way, whenever there is a process which is\ndifficult‚Ä¶ whenever there is a product which is hard to use, or difficult to\napply‚Äîthe copy writer‚Äôs \u0000rst task is to simplify that application in his\nprospect‚Äôs mind.\nÓÅ¢is holds especially true for new inventions which actually simplify\nprocesses which formerly were too difficult for the average prospect. A\nnew breakthrough is not merely accepted because its manufacturer says\nso. Its claims for ease and simplicity must be proved, in the ad, or the\nreader will simply shrug his shoulders and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just another\ncopywriter gone wild.‚Äù\nSuch a situation is one of the most frustrating experiences you can\nhave. Here is a product which you know is far easier to use than anything\never introduced in this \u0000eld before‚Äîbecause you‚Äôve used it! But no matter\nhow loud you scream EASY in your ads, people just seem to ignore you.\nWhat do you do? ÓÅ¢e answer is twofold:\n1. Rede\u0000ne (as this chapter shows you).\n2. Mechanize the new simplicity (as you‚Äôll see in the next chapter).\nRemember, innovation without acceptance is valueless. ÓÅ¢e more\npeople know that something is difficult, and the more revolutionary (and\ntherefore different) your product is‚Äîthe more resistance you will meet\nfrom them in accepting it.\n\nYou must, therefore, lay a base for acceptance by rede\u0000ning the entire\n\u0000eld for them, before you bring in your product.\nLet‚Äôs look at one more example of such breakthrough advertising, and\nsee the solutions the copy offered that made the product a success.\nOne of the great ads of all times, of course, is the Sherwin Cody ad.\nÓÅ¢ough most advertising men are familiar with the ad, they do not realize\nthat the course itself was a tremendous departure for the times‚Äîfar\neasier and simpler than anything else that had gone before.\nBut the prospects for such a course were absolutely convinced that\ngood English was too hard for them. ÓÅ¢ey had tried to learn it before, and\nhad failed. ÓÅ¢erefore, any new course that could be successfully sold to\nthem would have to rede\u0000ne English for them ‚Ä¶ rede\u0000ne mistakes in\nEnglish for them ‚Ä¶ and certainly rede\u0000ne the process of turning; bad\nEnglish into good English for them.\nÓÅ¢e Cody ad is a masterpiece of Gradualization. It should be\nmemorized‚Äînot merely studied‚Äîby every copywriter. However, within\nit, in four paragraphs, is contained another masterpiece of breakthrough\nrede\u0000nition‚Äîfrom hard to easy with a few simple ideas‚Äîthat goes like\nthis:\nOnly 15 Minutes a Day. Nor is there very much to learn.\nIn Mr. Cody‚Äôs years of experimenting, he brought to light\nsome highly astonishing facts about English.\nFor instance, statistics show that a list of sixty-nine\nwords (with their repetitions) make up more than half of all\nour speech and letter-writing. Obviously, if we could learn\nto spell, use and pronounce these words correctly, we\nwould go far toward eliminating incorrect spelling and\npronunciation.\nSimilarly, Mr. Cody proved that there were no more\nthan one dozen fundamental principles of punctuation. If\nwe mastered these principles, there would be no bugbear\nof punctuation to hamper us in our writing.\nFinally he discovered that twenty-five typical errors in\ngrammar constitute nine-tenths of our everyday mistakes.\nWhen one has learned how to avoid these twenty-five\npitfalls, how readily one can obtain the facility of speech\nwhich denotes the person of breeding and education!\n\nWhen the study of English is made so simple, it\nbecomes clear that progress can be made in a very short\ntime. No more than fifteen minutes a day is required\nÓÅ¢us the complicated becomes simple‚Äîthe hard becomes easy. ÓÅ¢is\nis the \u0000rst use of Rede\u0000nition. Now let‚Äôs look at the second:\n2. Escalation\nHere you are dealing with a product which works, and which is\nacknowledged to be easy enough to use‚Äîbut which simply does not have\nan appeal broad enough to assure it of a mass market.\nYour job here is to escalate your product. To give it more importance\nin your prospect‚Äôs eyes.\nYou do this again by Rede\u0000nition. You broaden the horizon of\nbene\u0000ts of the product. You rede\u0000ne the role that the product plays in the\nprospect‚Äôs life. You widen the area of reward that your product yields to\nthe prospect‚Äîshowing him that it enters into dozens of vital situations\nevery day, paving off for him where he might least expect it.\nFor example, let‚Äôs look at another ad for another English course forty\nyears later. By now people are not as sensitive to their punctuation or\ngrammar. Now the negative aspect has lost its appeal; people want good\nEnglish as a persuasion tool to win over other people.\nSo good English must cease to be an end in itself. It must be\nrede\u0000ned, to become instead a means to a more important end‚Äîone\nwhich is desired by far more people. And, since the positive aspect must\nnow be dominant, that part of good English which has the greatest value\nfor persuading people‚Äîvocabulary‚Äîmust now be featured.\nHere is the ad:\nREVOLUTIONARY NEW WORD POWER\nMACHINE MAKES YOU A MASTER OF ENGLISH\nOVERNIGHT.\nAutomatically gives you a power-packed vocabulary‚Äî\nto make your ideas crackle with excitement ‚Ä¶ to hold\nothers spellbound with the power of your speech and your\nwritten word.\n\nAutomatically spots embarrassing errors in grammar,\nspelling, pronunciation you didn‚Äôt even know you were\nmaking. Clears them up at once. Frees your mind from\nworry ‚Ä¶ lets you feel at ease in any company ‚Ä¶ gives you\nthe blazing new self-confidence you need to make\nanybody like you‚Äîto win people over irresistibly to your\npoint of view‚Ä¶ .\nÓÅ¢is approach rede\u0000nes the bene\u0000ts of the product, shiÓÇùing them\nfrom a less desirable area to one that will generate more sales appeal.\nBut this use of escalation‚Äîto increase bene\u0000t appeal‚Äîis only one of\nthe ways it can serve you. Another is to increase the importance of the\nproduct‚Äîshowing that something the prospect wants very much hinges\ndirectly upon the performance of your product.\nFor example, in an ad for spark plugs, this fact was pointed out to the\nreader:\nYes. You pay $2,000 ‚Ä¶ $3,000 ‚Ä¶ $4,000 for your car.\nAnd a single 99c part robs you of the real power and\nenjoyment that car should give you.\nOr here, in an advertisement for a speed math course:\nIf you want to get ahead fast‚Ä¶ if you want a position of\nreal importance and responsibility‚Äîthen a knowledge of\nthis kind of super-fast, super-accurate mathematics is AN\nABSOLUTE NECESSITY for your future!\nOr escalation can be used to show the prospect that your product is\nnot something to be put to work just once or twice a week‚Äîbut that it\nwill be needed, and used, by him almost even waking minute. Here‚Äôs how\nthis was done, in a single sub headline, in an ad for a course on handling\npeople:\nYour Entire Life is Spent Trying to Get Others to Do What You Want‚Äî\nWithout Friction\nYou must agree with this statement. And therefore you must rede\u0000ne\nthe importance to yourself of a technique which allows you to accomplish\nthe all-pervading task more easily, more effectively and more rapidly\n\nÓÅ¢is is the second use of Rede\u0000nition‚Äîescalation. Now let‚Äôs look at\nthe third.\n3. Price Reduction\nHere you have the product which, quite simply, costs too much. Your\njob is to make that price seem less. You do it by a very simple act of\nrede\u0000nition, like this:\nWhy does the product cost too much? Because it‚Äôs being compared\nwith other products in the same \u0000eld. And how do you whittle away,\npsychologically, at this price? By switching the comparison, and relating it\nto some other, more expensive standard.\nFor example, here is an enormously successful mail order ad for spark\nplugs, which sold for $1.49 each, or one and a half times the standard for\nthe \u0000eld, and twice as much as the discount price. Did the copywriter\ntherefore say that ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ey may cost a little more, but they‚Äôre worth every\ncent of it.‚Äù Of course not. He made them cheap, and he did it in these two\nparagraphs of psychological rede\u0000nition:\nUp to now these extraordinary SA FIRE INJECTORS\nwere practically made by hand and would have to sell for\nas high as $5 each. But we knew that 30 or 40 dollars was\nmore than the average driver could afford‚Äîso we decided\nto get the price down so low that these injectors would\npay for themselves 12 times in one year of driving. So here\nis my astonishing proposition. If you will check your cars\nperformance before and after you install your SA Fire\nInjector System and then tell your friends and neighbors\nabout them, here is what I am prepared to do for you:\nYou can have a set of SA FIRE INJECTORS for the year\nand model of your ear for only a fraction of their value. If\nyou act now they are only $1.49 each‚Ä¶\nDo you see how he does it? Do you see how many times he does it in\nthese two short paragraphs? As a last review of rede\u0000nition‚Äîbecause its\ntechniques are so important to you‚Äîlet‚Äôs just list the individual phrases\nthat build up again and again, the feeling of value and bargain.\nHere they are. Did you catch them all?\n\n‚Äúpractically made by hand ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚Äúwould have to sell for as high as $5 each ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚Äú30 or 40 dollars ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Notice that he repeats the hand-made price\ntwice. First he gives it to you per plug; and then for the entire set. ÓÅ¢us the\nnew comparative price is reinforced; you practically wince at the $40\n\u0000gure since you want the plugs by this time. And you‚Äôre going to feel\npretty good when he brings in the now-lower \u0000gure in the next\nparagraph.)\n‚Äúget the price down so low ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Here is the magic word, ‚Äúlow‚Äù; now\nlegitimatized in your eyes by the description of the hand-made set in the\nphrases that preceded it.)\n‚Äúthat these injectors would pay for themselves 12 times in one year\nof driving‚Ä¶‚Äù (Not only value, but reward. Not only low-priced, but gas-\nsaving. And again, the comparison to a higher \u0000gure‚Äîthis time the\nmoney you‚Äôll save on gas.)\n‚Äúastonishing proposition ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Now the price becomes so low that the\nmere statement of it may cause you surprise. It may sound slightly corny\nas we dissect it here, but it is incredibly effective in the context of the ad.\nAnd most of it‚Äîperhaps all of it‚Äîis never consciously noticed by the\nprospect. He simply realizes that he feels that a bargain is being offered to\nhim.)\n‚ÄúIf you will check your car‚Äôs performance‚Ä¶ and tell your friends and\nneighbors about them ‚Ä¶‚Äù (ÓÅ¢e introduction of a condition‚Äîan action\nyou must perform‚Äîin order to get the now-low price. Used before in the\nlast chapter in a different context: here we see how the same device works\nagain to substantiate with equal power, the feeling of value.)\n‚Äúprepared to do ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Again the connotation of favor, of allowance, of\ndiscount.)\n‚ÄúYou can have ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Not, ‚ÄúYou can buy.‚Äù He is letting you have the\nplugs at the low price. Again, he is doing you a favor. You are getting a\nbargain.)\n‚Äúonly $1.49 each ‚Ä¶‚Äù (ÓÅ¢e classic modi\u0000er. ÓÅ¢e tenth bargain-phrase\nin these two paragraphs.)\nNotice how similar Gradualization and Rede\u0000nition are. Notice how\neach operates below the surface of the conscious mind. Gradualization by\nits structure‚Äîby its arrangement of facts and phrases. Rede\u0000nition by its\nrearrangement of perspective.\n\nEach is an extremely subtle and powerful way of building belief. Each\ndeserves much more study than we can give it in this book.\nLet us now turn to some equally powerful but more apparent\nmechanisms that also build belief.\n\n6\n-\nTHE FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY:\nMECHANIZATION\nHow to Verbally Prove ÓÅ¢at Your\nProduct Does What You Claim\nAs we have observed repeatedly, good advertising copy exists\nsimultaneously in two different places. Part of that copy is words on a\npage. Or sounds carried by radio waves. Or pictures and sounds coming\nout of a television set. But the other part of that copy‚Äîthe crucial part‚Äî\ntakes place in your prospect‚Äôs brain. It is the series of reactions‚Äîplanned\nreactions and anticipated reactions‚Äîthat your copy causes in his mind\nand his emotions.\nActually, when your prospect reads your copy, he is engaging in a\nsilent dialogue with you. You are feeding him ideas and images and\nemotions, in a planned pattern; and he is feeding back to you reactions to\nthese ideas and images and emotions.\nYou hope‚Äîyou plan‚Äîthat these reactions will be favorable. ÓÅ¢at they\nwill be controlled reactions. ÓÅ¢at he will see the images you are projecting.\nÓÅ¢at he will understand and agree with the ideas that you are advocating.\nÓÅ¢at he will share the emotions you are suggesting he feel, and even\nembellish and intensify them.\nBut also, at the same moment, you must be aware of the fact that‚Äî\nincluded among these reactions‚Äîare also a number of inevitable\nanticipations, or demands, or questions on his part. And you must\nanswer these questions or your copy will fail.\nWhat are these demands he is going to make from time to time on\nyour copy? Basically they fall into three classes:\n1. Demands for more information, more image, more desire. You\nhave whetted his appetite; now you‚Äôve got to satisfy it. He is saying to you:\n‚ÄúTell me more.‚Äù\n2. Demands for proof. He knows he wants it; now he wants to know\nthat it‚Äôs true. He is telling you: ‚ÄúOh yeah? Who says so?‚Äù\n3. Demands for a mechanism. He knows he wants the end result; now\nhe wants to know how you‚Äôre going to give it to him. He is saying: ‚ÄúHow\ndoes it work?‚Äù\n\nTo write good copy, you have to play a dual role. At the same time,\nyou have to be copywriter and prospect. You have to develop an almost\nfoolproof sensitivity to these inevitable reactions. You have to know the\nexact point that they are going to come in. You have to anticipate them.\nYou have to switch copy direction, \u0000ll in the wanted material, at the\nprecise point that your prospect loses interest in one theme and demands\nthe other. ÓÅ¢is is one of the most difficult parts of writing copy, and the\nexact spot where many good ads break down and lose their prospect.\nAnd‚Äîsince such anticipation points occur several times in a single ad‚Äî\nyou will \u0000nd yourself working over the same paragraph of ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù\ncopy hour aÓÇùer hour. All you know is that at this point something went\nwrong‚Äîat this point your prospect is dissatis\u0000ed.\nWe will discuss these problems of copy direction ‚Ä¶ anticipation points\n‚Ä¶ etc. in Chapter 14, on Interweaving. At this point, however, let‚Äôs look\nmore closely at the third demand: the demand for Mechanism.\nVerbal Proof\nÓÅ¢is is the vital question: ‚ÄúHow does it work?‚Äù Your prospect is asking\nyou here to give him a mechanism. He likes what you promise‚Äîhe wants\nwhat you promise‚Äîbut he has to be convinced that your product can\nactually give it to him.\nYou have to demonstrate your product, in words, logically, so that he\ncan understand exactly HOW it gives him the end result you promise.\nSince the beginning of advertising, of course, the copy that furnishes\nthis information‚Äîthat provides this mechanism‚Äîhas been called\n‚ÄúReason Why‚Äù copy. Claude Hopkins was its master. But there have been\nfew great selling ads of any period that do not use it to convince their\nprospect that their product actually works.\nIn fact, the basic question you must ask yourself, about this device,\nwhen you sit down to write a piece of copy, is not, ‚ÄúShould I use it?‚Äù Or\n‚ÄúShould I build a mechanism into this copy?‚Äù But simply: ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù\nHow much mechanism does this copy need? ÓÅ¢is, of course, depends\n‚Äîas so many other things in your copy‚Äîon the State of Awareness of\nyour prospect. Is he familiar with the mechanism by which this product\nworks? Does he accept it? If so, then this part of your job is done for you.\nOther advertisers have spent their money to make this mechanism\nfamiliar to your prospect.\n\nStage One: Name the Mechanism\nYou may now take advantage of their investment by simply naming\nthe mechanism, and going on to beat them with your price or other\nfeatures.\nFor instance, in the conventional camera ad, to back the headline\nclaim, all that you‚Äôd have to do is name your mechanisms, like this:\nTAKE FOOLPROOF PHOTOS WITH THE XENOPHON 1750\nWith Electronic Light Setter‚Ä¶ Push-Button Zomar Lens ‚Ä¶ Magazine\nLoad ‚Ä¶ Only $135.\nHere, the three mechanisms which ensure the perfect pictures are\nsimply named, and not described at all. ÓÅ¢e prospect is already familiar\nwith the way they work from the other ads he has seen, and any further\ndetailing of their nuts and bolts would simply bore him. ÓÅ¢erefore, you\nname them in as bold type as possible, and go on to compete with your\nprice.\nMost catalog copy and retail copy needs to assume only this\nabbreviated form. It deals with products which are already known, and\nwhose mechanisms are already understood and accepted. ÓÅ¢erefore, any\nfurther wordage on these points would only be wasted.\nBut now we come to that vast array of products whose mechanism\ncannot simply be named. Why? For two basic reasons:\nStage Two: Describe the Mechanism\n1. Because the prospect doesn‚Äôt understand their mechanism. And:\n2. Because everybody else has the same mechanism, and the same\npromise, and the same price. And the market is getting tired, and you\nneed a new way to compete.\nLet‚Äôs look at the simplest case‚Äîcase #1‚Äî\u0000rst:\nHere your mechanism is not so well known, or not known at all, and\nyou can‚Äôt simply name it. You have to go into more detail; you have to\ndescribe it.\nSo you have the classic situation of Promise‚ÄîReason Why. You build\na strong, quick promise‚Äîand then you follow up with the reason why\nyou can deliver that promise.\n\nÓÅ¢is one-two punch of promise and reason why is as old as\nadvertising itself. Here, for instance, is how Rinso used it in 1926. First\nthey give the promise, like this:\nWho else wants a whiter wash‚Äîwith no hard work?\nHow would you like to see your wash come out of a simple\nsoaking‚Äîwhiter than hours of scrubbing could make it!\nMillions of women do it every week. They‚Äôve given up\nwashboards for good. They‚Äôve freed themselves forever\nfrom the hard work and reddened hands of washday.\nNow they just soak‚Äîrinse‚Äîand hang out to dry! In half\nthe time, without a bit of hard rubbing, the wash is on the\nline‚Äîwhiter than ever!\nNotice how the original promise in the headline has been taken and\nintensi\u0000ed in these \u0000rst three paragraphs of copy. ÓÅ¢e promise is repeated,\nin different words and from different perspectives, over and over again in\nthose \u0000rst three paragraphs.\nBut notice too that‚Äîas the copy builds desire‚Äîit also builds a\ngrowing reaction on the part of the woman reading it. ÓÅ¢is reaction can\nbe expressed in one word: ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù ÓÅ¢is promise sounds better and better\n‚Ä¶ it begins to sound too good to be true ‚Ä¶ now she needs reassurance\nfast.\nSo the whiteness claims stop. ÓÅ¢e copy shiÓÇùs direction‚Äîand now\nbegins to sell the mechanism, like this:\nDirt floats off‚Äîstains go. The secret is simply Rinso‚Äîa\nmild, granulated soap that gives rich, lasting suds even in\nthe hardest water.\nJust soak the clothes in the creamy Rinso suds‚Äîand\nthe dirt and stains float off. Rinse‚Äîand the wash is\nspotless.\nEven the most soiled parts need only a gentle rub\nbetween the fingers to make them snowy. Thus clothes\nlast longer, for there‚Äôs no hard rubbing against a board.\nNotice, \u0000rst of all, that this mechanism‚Äîthe suds that \u0000oat off dirt‚Äî\nis sold just as hard as the whiteness story it is brought in to prove. ÓÅ¢e\n\u0000rst rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scienti\u0000c discourse. You must\nnever allow it to become dull, or merely factual. You must load it with\n\npromise, load it with emotion. Every word in good copy‚Äîincluding\nmechanism copy‚Äîsells. Only in these paragraphs, the copy is selling a\nsecondary claim (dirt \u0000oating off) that proves the primary claim (a\nwhiter wash). But still‚Äîit sells.\nSecondly, of course, you‚Äôll immediately notice how simple the\nmechanism is in this 1926 copy, as compared with the same \u0000eld today. In\nthose days it was enough to mention the facts that the suds \u0000oated off the\ndirt; the reader accepted, as an evident truth, the fact that they would do\nso.\nToday, of course, in our much more sophisticated and exploited\nmarket, she would no longer do so. Today you would need far more\nmechanism. You would have to explain more, promise deeper, perhaps\neven invent a miracle ingredient to do the work for you.\nStage ÓÅ¢ree: Feature the Mechanism\nWhich brings us to case #2 and the difficult problem of what to do\nwhen your market is highly sophisticated ‚Ä¶ when promises sound alike\n‚Ä¶ when price competition becomes suicidal?\nÓÅ¢is takes us back to Chapter 3, where we discussed market-\nsophistication from another perspective. Here we discovered that\nmechanism‚Äîstrong mechanism‚Äîsaleable mechanism‚Äîis not only a way\nto build belief, but may actually become so important to the success of\nyour product that you must put it into the headline.\nÓÅ¢ese headlines are all mechanism headlines:\n‚ÄúFLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING.‚Äù\n‚ÄúRUN YOUR CAR WITHOUT SPARK PLUGS.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTOMMY ARMOUR SAYS SMACK HELL OUT OF THE BALL WITH\nYOUR RIGHT HAND.‚Äù\nAnd hundreds more. Every one of them offers you a new way to get\nwhat you‚Äôve been wanting. A NEW WAY; a new mechanism; a new chance\nto satisfy your desire‚Äîeven if everything else you‚Äôve tried has failed you.\n\nMechanism, therefore, can be inside your ad, to prove your main\nclaim, or on top of the ad, elevated by the state of your market to\nbecoming the main claim.\nIf people assume that they know how your product works, or if your\nclaim is so new that they don‚Äôt care, then all the mechanism you need can\nbe summed up in a word or a phrase.\nIf people are not quite sure how it works, describe the mechanism‚Äîin\nselling language‚Äîuntil they have enough reason-why to believe you.\nIf you have, however, an exceptionally strong or dramatic mechanism,\nor if you want to establish de\u0000nite superiority to other competing\nproducts, then sell hell out of that mechanism. We‚Äôll see some expert\nexamples of how to do this in our next chapter, on Concentration‚Äîwhen\nwe‚Äôre shown how to compare your product with the rest of your \u0000eld.\nOn the Importance of Mechanism When You\nWant to Convince\nYour Reader ÓÅ¢at You‚Äôre Giving Him a Bargain\nOne of the sad truths of our time‚Äîand profession‚Äîis that our\nreaders do not always believe the truth when we tell it to them. Every\ncopy writer has had, at one time or another, a perfectly marvelous\nproduct that just couldn‚Äôt be sold‚Äîbecause people wouldn‚Äôt believe that it\ncould do what he knew it could do.\nIn the same way many manufacturers, and their agencies, are startled\nwhen they cut a price‚Äîadvertise the reduction‚Äîand see no increase in\nsales.\nWhat happened? No one believed them. A price cut‚Äîlike a product\nadvantage‚Äîis only as good as your words, and your strategy, makes it.\nPrice cuts must be justi\u0000ed. ÓÅ¢ere must be a reason for them. A\nmechanism behind them. Without such a mechanism‚Äîwithout such a\nreason-why you should give this bargain‚Äîyou are going to get only a\nfraction of its real sales power.\nÓÅ¢e great master of price-cut mechanization was Robert Collier. His\nbook‚ÄîÓÇªe Robert Collier Letter Book‚Äîis one of the great classics of\ncopywriting know-how. Here is just one example of how Collier made his\nprice-cuts, not only believable, but dramatic:\n\nBefore the Price Goes Up! Dear Sir: A short time ago\none of the old, reliable mills that makes the finer qualities\nof woven Madras for shirts began sending out S.O.S. calls.\nThey had kept their plant going steadily for months,\nthinking that the usual demand would easily take care of\ntheir excess output.\nBut, with the weather so generally unseasonable, the\nusual demand didn‚Äôt materialize. And there they were,\nheavily overstocked‚Äîand needing money.\nIf we would take all their surplus stock of the finer\ngrades of woven Madras, amounting to a quarter of a\nmillion yards, they offered to let us have them at way\nbelow any price we had ever paid for shirtings in all our\nyears in business‚Äîat far less than they could make the\nmaterials and sell them for today.\nWe took them‚Äîthe whole quarter-million yards‚Äîat a\ntremendous savings in cost‚Ä¶\nA Bargain You May Never Get Again‚Ä¶\nLet me point out the difference between this logical, carefully\nprepared introduction to the price slash, and a simple, bare\nannouncement of that slash. Here, the copy writer not only emphasizes\nbargain over and over again, but brings in quality as a counter-desire time\naÓÇùer time. He thus uses a mechanism within a mechanism: (1) the\nunseasonable weather causing (2) the factory to become overstocked\nresulting in the primary markdown‚Äîto build belief upon belief.\nHere the copy starts with the mechanism, and only goes into the\nbargain claims six paragraphs later. Again, he has taken the Creative\nGamble: in this case, that he could hold the reader‚Äôs interest for those six\nparagraphs. And, because of this gamble, he reaps ten times the\nbelievability for even word he said about the bargain-value of his offer\nfrom that point on.\n\n7\n-\nTHE SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY:\nCONCENTRATION\nHow to Destroy Alternate Ways for\nYour Prospect to Satisfy His Desire\nAs you know, in the \u0000nal analysis, no successful copy ever sells a\nproduct. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire. And its power to\nsell ultimately comes from the intensity of that desire.\nIf the desire is commercial‚Äîthat is, if it is shared by masses of people,\nand if each of these people want that satisfaction enough to pay the price\nrequired for a mechanism to satisfy it‚Äîthen it is highly probable that\nmany \u0000rms will try to deliver that mechanism, or product, to them.\nÓÅ¢e almost universal condition of commercial life is competition. No\none who sells anything, of course, can avoid it. As you write, one eye is\n\u0000xed on your market, and the other on your competitors.\nWe have described in this book several different ways of beating\ncompetition. Let‚Äôs stop for a moment and review them:\nFirst, of course, is superiority of product. ÓÅ¢is is the ultimate weapon\nin the war for the consumer‚Äôs dollar. If you produce the best product,\nyour advertising has a hundred times the chance of success than if you\nproduce only a fair product. Most great ads have been associated with\ngreat products. Most great copy claims come from the assembly line. If\nyours does not, if your copy is better than your product, then send it to\nyour client instead of your prospect, and tell him to make it a reality.\nBut even the best product needs equally as effective copy to induce\npeople to try it. Otherwise, the excessive cost of getting the \u0000rst purchase\nmay drive the product off the market, before the repeat sales can build up\nhigh enough to earn it through. So we come to our second weapon to\nbeat competition‚Äîsuperiority of promise. A stronger promise, that\nevokes more desire. A wider promise, that causes more people to buy. A\nmore believable promise, that brings in the skeptics as well as the\nsusceptible. ÓÅ¢is entire book has been a blueprint for developing such\npromises.\nÓÅ¢ird, we have the weapon of product-role. ÓÅ¢e role the product\nallows its consumer to play. ÓÅ¢e personality, the identi\u0000cation, the\n\nprestige, the status, the excitement you can bring out of your product, or\ngraÓÇù onto it.\nFourth, we have response and reaction as a competitive force‚Äîthe\nability to one-up the competition: to escalate claims when necessary; to\nshiÓÇù mechanisms; to invade new markets.\nAnd \u0000ÓÇùh‚Äîthe technique we will discuss in this chapter‚Äîis direct\nattack.\nDirect attack‚Äîthe mechanism of Concentration‚Äîdiffers completely\nfrom the other four methods we have discussed above. All these\ntechniques have the common element of ignoring the competition. ÓÅ¢ey\nconcentrate on your story, your promises, your bene\u0000ts, your product.\nÓÅ¢ey act as though there is no other one possible of gaining the\nsatisfaction your prospect desires.\nÓÅ¢erefore, they are most effective when you dominate a \u0000eld, when\nyour primary problem is to protect your customers‚Äô loyalty against the\nclaims of your competitor, or when your story is so powerful, so different,\nor so fresh that the competition has nothing to match it. In these cases,\nit‚Äôs better not to give him the prestige of attack, not to mention his claims\nor his product, even invidiously, in the space which costs you such a dear\ndollar.\nBut in many other cases‚Äîespecially where your advertising budget is\nmuch less than his‚Äîespecially where the bulk of your prospects are\nalready customers of his‚Äîyour \u0000rst problem may be to crack his image,\nto shatter their loyalty, before you can re-channel their desire around to\nyou.\nWhat Concentration Is\nBut this process of Concentration‚Äîthis careful, logical, documented\nprocess of proving ineffectual other ways of satisfying your prospect‚Äôs\ndesire‚Äîis much more than mere attack. If you can only attack another\nproduct‚Äîwithout showing at the same time, by comparison, how your\nproduct provides what the other lacks‚Äîthen say nothing at all! Never\nattack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at\nthe same time!\nÓÅ¢e reason for this is simple. Your prospect knows that your attack is\nbiased. If, therefore, you are attacking another product only for your own\ngood‚Äîin other words, to win the sale by disparaging your competitor‚Äî\n\nwhat you will probably evoke in his mind is skepticism and dislike, and\nvery little else.\nBut‚Äîand this is the critical point in this process‚Äîif you can show\nyour customer that this attack is for his own good, in his service, because\nyour product will eliminate this weakness, then you have a sales story he\nwill accept. ÓÅ¢en you will make him question even the most ingrained\nloyalty.\nConcentration, therefore, is the process of pointing out weaknesses in\nthe competition ‚Ä¶ emphasizing their disservice to your prospect ‚Ä¶ and\nthen proving to him that your product gives him what he wants without\nthem.\nNotice that all the techniques that we have developed in the last few\nchapters are used here. Intensi\u0000cation to show the penalties of continuing\nwith the old product. Gradualization to show the logical cause of the\nweaknesses and how they can now be cured. Mechanization to prove that\nyour product removes the weakness. And so on.\nConcentration is therefore a complicated process, taking up sizable\nspace to do its job properly, and combining almost every trick you have\nlearned in this book. To see how incredibly effective it can be, however,\nlet us look at two masterful examples.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is our spark plug ad again. As you remember, in the copy, the\ncopy writer has told his prospect that he can run his car without spark\nplugs, that he can get more gas mileage and more power if he puts ‚Äú\u0000re\ninjectors‚Äù into his car instead of the old-fashioned plugs.\nNow he goes on to:\n1. Provide the mechanisms which prove his own claim; and\n2. To destroy the prospect‚Äôs con\u0000dence in plugs forever, in this\nbrilliant piece of interweaving copy:\nMECHANICS AND ENGINEERS READ THIS\nCAREFULLY\nAnd for you mechanics and engineers let me tell you\nwhy fire injection must give you these results.\nA spark plug jumps a spark of electricity across an air\ngap. This is the most wasteful and power consuming way\nto get electricity from one place to another and it limits\nthe size of the spark.\n\nA fire injector fires on the surface of an electrical\nconductor. This is the most efficient way to get a big\npowerful spark into your cylinder.\nOn ordinary spark plugs the air gap between the\nelectrode and the firing point is always getting bigger\nbecause the electrode is always burning away. This means\nyou have misfiring which means loss of power plus wasted\ngas plus raw gas to damage the cylinders and piston rings.\nOn fire injectors there is no air gap and no electrode to burn\naway. That means maximum gas explosion which means\nfull power, full economy and no raw gas to wash away the\noil protection from cylinder walls and pistons.\nA spark plug accumulates filth and carbon because oi\ninefficient firing. This means you need regular cleaning,\nsetting and expensive replacement!\nA fire injector never needs cleaning or setting. It actually\n‚Äúbreaks in‚Äù and becomes more efficient with use. It will\nactually outlast your car, delivering maximum efficiency\nwithout servicing or replacement.\nA spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark that actually\nblows out under pressure of less than 120 pounds.\nA fire injector gives you a heavy powerful flame that\nwill not blow out at pressures far heavier than those\ncreated by even the highest compression engine‚Ä¶\nWith ordinary spark plugs you are using, or should be\nusing premium gas which costs from 4 to 8 cents more than\nordinary gas, and despite this you‚Äôre getting inefficient,\nwasteful gas consumption.\nWith fire injectors regular gas will give you up to 8 more\ngas miles per gallon, up to 31 more horsepower, plus easier\nstarting in all weather. Add these savings together and see\nfor yourself why I say that fire injectors will pay for\nthemselves every single month that you drive your car.\nOrdinary spark plugs have to be replaced regularly. In\nsome of the new high-compression cars, a set of plugs will\nburn up in a couple of months.\nA fire injector installation is guaranteed for the life of\nyour car without cleaning, servicing, or replacing.\n\nThese are some of the reasons that the U.S. Air Force\npays premium prices for surface supported injectors for their\naircraft and why you will ultimately find fire injectors in all\nautomobiles‚Ä¶\nLet‚Äôs See How He Does It\nI hope that by now you have spotted many of the techniques he uses\nto gain his effects ‚Ä¶ to build the overall power of this sequence. Let‚Äôs just\ncheck off a few of them right now:\nFirst, of course, is the interweaving contrast. A weakness in the\noperation of the spark plug is pointed out, and then immediately\ncounteracted by the bene\u0000t the injector gives you. Bad‚Äîgood; bad‚Äî\ngood; bad‚Äîgood: this is the underlying structure of this sequence.\nBut this is only one use he makes of parallelism. He repeats words to\ncontrast the inherent weakness of the plug with the inherent strength of\nthe injector. ‚ÄúA spark plug jumps a spark.‚Äù ‚ÄúA \u0000re injector \u0000res on‚Ä¶‚Äù Spark\nis a weak word; \u0000re is much stronger visually. And he later intensi\u0000es this\ncontrast of image by saying: ‚ÄúA spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark,\nagainst ‚ÄúA \u0000re injector gives you a heavy, powerful \u0000ame‚Ä¶‚Äù You can\npicture the difference.\nÓÅ¢roughout the copy, de\u0000nition and re-de\u0000nition take place. Spark\n\u0000ring is the ‚Äúmost wasteful and power consuming way‚Äù as opposed to\n‚Äúthe most efficient way to get a big powerful spark.‚Äù Mis\u0000ring means ‚Äúloss\nof power plus‚Ä¶‚Äù while maximum gas explosion means ‚Äúfull power, full\neconomy‚Ä¶‚Äù (Notice the parallel sentence structure here sharpening the\ncontrast.)\nAnd, in a beautiful image, the \u0000re injector actually ‚Äúbreaks in‚Äù‚Äîa\nmasterpiece of rede\u0000nition by analogy.\nOf course, almost every bene\u0000t has its documentary mechanism. ÓÅ¢e\nair gap in ordinary plugs gets bigger ‚Äúbecause the electrode is burning\naway.‚Äù ÓÅ¢e spark plug gets dirty ‚Äúbecause of inefficient \u0000ring.‚Äù And so on.\nLet me point out again the general structure of this sequence. It is:\nBad.\nGood.\nBad.\nGood.\nBad.\n\nGood.\nAnd so on. It thus offers repeated, direct, one-for-one contrast. It\nexplores a number of performance factors of vital interest in the prospect\n‚Äîshowing the bad and then the good side of each of them.\nA Second Strategy\nÓÅ¢is is one way of accomplishing your Concentration. But, of course,\nit is not always feasible, because the points you wish to contrast may not\nbe so easily and clearly broken down, one by one. You may be dealing,\ninstead, with a time sequence‚Äîa recurring, unpleasant experience with\nwhich the prospect is familiar, and which you wish to sharpen before you\nprovide him with the antidote.\nIn this case your Concentration copy would adopt a different\nstructure. Something that looks more like this:\nWhat happens to you now, with the product or products you are\nusing currently?\nWhat will happen when you switch to the new product?\nHere is such a structure, for an ad selling a reducing pill. Let‚Äôs look\n\u0000rst at the negative copy:\nFor years doctors have known that ordinary reducing\nplans‚Äîthat you pay $5, $10 and even $15 for in the stores\n‚Äîare completely passive! That they depend strictly on your\nown will power‚Äîon your ability to starve that fat off your\nbody. All that these ordinary reducing plans are able to\ngive you ‚Ä¶ for your $5 or 810 or S15‚Äîare HUNGER-\nAPPEASING PRODUCTS‚Äîpills, powders and liquids that\ndo nothing more than swell up in your stomach‚Äîthat do\nnothing more than ‚Äúdull‚Äù your hunger a little.\nBut not one of these products could do anything to\nACTIVELY help you reduce your weight. To take the strain\noff that starvation diet. To actually help you BURN UP that\nugly fat‚Ä¶ OXIDIZE that fat‚Ä¶ MELT IT AWAY‚ÄîFOREVER!\nSo what happened? If you were overweight, you\nstruggled to do the job of reducing BY YOURSELF! You\ntook your hunger-appeasing pills religiously. You pushed\naway the foods you love. You spent week after week of\n\ntorture. And finally, if you were lucky; you carved off 5, 10,\nor even 12 precious pounds.\nAnd then your will power snapped! You broke your\nterrible diet. You discovered that your little pills were\nuseless to keep you away from the foods you loved. And\nthe fat flowed back‚Äîheavier and uglier and more deadly\nthan ever before!\nAgain, let‚Äôs glance at the means the writer used to get his total effect.\nIn the \u0000rst and second paragraphs‚ÄîDe\u0000nitions and Rede\u0000nition.\nOrdinary reducing plans are passive. ÓÅ¢ey depend on your own will\npower. ÓÅ¢ey can do nothing to actively burn up fat.\nAnd in the third paragraph, the equating of taking ordinary reducing\npills with ‚Äúdoing the job of reducing yourself.‚Äù\nNext, logic‚Äîcause and effect. Given the acceptance of these\nde\u0000nitions by the reader, the third and fourth paragraphs become a\nlogical necessity. ÓÅ¢is tone of cause and effect is conveyed in the phrase:\n‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù\nNow, of course, the third and fourth paragraphs condense an\nexperience which is all too common to every woman who has ever tried\nto reduce. She has lived through this herself, time aÓÇùer time. She\nrecognizes each of the symptoms. And so she \u0000nds herself nodding her\nhead, agreeing with each in its turn, building up a stream of acceptances\nwhich carries more and more conviction as she \u0000nds her own experiences\nmore and more thoroughly described.\nAnd then, at the climax, in the last line of the fourth paragraph, the\ndestruction of the old methods of reducing is complete. Notice the use of\nthe word ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù to tie this \u0000nal indictment in structurally with the stream\nof sensory experiences that have gone before it. ÓÅ¢ere is no doubt that the\nfat has come back again in this woman‚Äôs life‚Äîif it hadn‚Äôt, she wouldn‚Äôt\nhave read this much of the ad. But here the inevitable implication buried in\na sentence with which no woman could disagree‚Äîis that it was the failure\nof the pills that caused the failure of the diet.\nÓÅ¢us the stage is set for the hero-product to emerge. It has already\nbeen foreshadowed in the second paragraph‚Äîin the negative accusations\nthat these ordinary methods can do nothing ‚Äúactively‚Äù to ‚Äúburn away‚Äù fat.\nNow the copy goes on, from failure to promise, like this:\n\nAnd so you tried another passive plan. And another.\nAnd another. And then if you were like the men and\nwomen whose fantastic case histories were reported by\nleading medical journals‚Äîperhaps you went to your\ndoctor and asked him for an easy way out‚Äîwithout torture\n‚Äîand without sliding back!\nThese doctors had the answer in a tiny grey pill‚Äîand a\ncommon-sense plan.\nIn their hands‚Äîso tiny that they could balance it on\nthe tip of their little finger‚Äîwas perhaps the greatest\nweapon ever discovered against deadly, excess fat. It was\na miraculous compound called LECITHIN‚Äîbrand-new‚Äî\nwhose amazing fat-dissolving properties had been\ndiscovered by a Nobel prize winner‚Äîthe co-discoverer of\ninsulin‚Ä¶\nBecause this product was perfectly safe‚Äîand as easy\nto take as an aspirin‚Äîmany had used it themselves when\nthey wanted to lose weight‚Ä¶\nThey were not given am starvation diets ‚Ä¶ they never\nexperienced a single hungry moment ‚Ä¶ they reported, in\ncase after case, that they felt more pep, more energy,\nmore youth and vitality than they had known in years!\nAnd then, day after day faster and easier and safer\nthan they had ever known before, the ugly excess fat\naround their bodies melted away! While they were eating\nthree delicious meals a day, they were shedding as much\nas 5 pounds a week. While they were feasting on mouth-\nwatering steaks‚Ä¶\nAnd so on. Right back into Intensi\u0000cation copy, with its strong\npicture-image sell.\nHere are your contrast‚Äîyour mechanization‚Äîyour documentation\n‚Äîyour reference to authority‚Äîand then your return to promise, in the\nform of case history, which now has many times its original power, based\non both the elimination of alternate channels of ful\u0000llment, and the\nstrong supporting mechanism which documents its claims.\nOne Final Word on Concentration\n\nI have purposely chosen extreme examples to illustrate each\nmechanism. ÓÅ¢ese copy blocks are longer than Concentration need\nlogically be. ÓÅ¢e same effect may be boiled down into two or three\nsentences, or even a single phrase, as in this classic headline:\n‚ÄúSHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY.‚Äù\nHere is contrast‚Äîimplied weakness in other products‚Äî\ncompensating promise in your own.\nAgain, it is not the content, nor is it the length of copy used in a\nmechanism that makes it effective. It is simply and solely the problem it\nsolves for you in the development of your copy‚Äîby the emotional\nreaction it produces on your reader when he encounters it.\nIf, in this case, you have caused him to question a habit ‚Ä¶ shiÓÇù a\nloyalty ‚Ä¶ take a chance on your product‚Äîyou have done your job, no\nmatter how few or how many words you have used to do it.\n\n8\n-\nTHE SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF\nBREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFLAGE\nHow to Borrow Conviction for Your Copy\nWe have now discussed \u0000ve separate ways to build believability into\nyour copy. I do not think we should leave this subject without at least\nmentioning one other, entirely different, approach‚Äîthat of borrowing\nbelievability from all the places in our society where it is stored up.\nÓÅ¢e process by which you do this is quite simple. As you know, people\ndo not buy a newspaper, or a magazine, or any other medium of\ncommunication for its ads at all. ÓÅ¢ey buy this publication‚Äîor they turn\non their radio and television set‚Äîto keep in touch with the world around\nthem; to learn what‚Äôs happening, and why it‚Äôs happening. To be\nentertained, or enlightened, or simply kept up to date.\nNow, when a person chooses one of the publications (and for a\nmoment we‚Äôll disregard radio and television), he does so because he\nbelieves that that publication is telling him the truth. He has faith in that\npublication. He believes in it.\nAnd, as long as he has faith in that publication (as any space buyer\ncan tell you) it remains an excellent medium for advertising‚Äîbecause\nsome of his trust carries over from the editorial pages to the advertising\npages. He simply assumes that his publication wouldn‚Äôt carry the ad if it\nweren‚Äôt true.\nAnd, on the other hand, when he loses faith in that publication, the\neffectiveness of its advertising just goes to pieces. If he no longer believes\nin the publication, he won‚Äôt believe in the advertising it carries. ÓÅ¢is\nfactor‚Äîthe believability in the medium itself‚ÄîI think is a far more\nimportant consideration in buying space than mere circulation.\nAll this is of vital interest to the space buyer, of course, but we have to\ngo a step further. You see, not only does this reader come to believe in the\npublication which he buys repeatedly, but aÓÇùer a while he becomes used\nto receiving his truth couched in the style and format and phraseology of\nthat particular publication. In other words, a conditioned re\u0000ex has been\nformed here. ÓÅ¢e man believes in the publication. ÓÅ¢e publication\nphrases its material in a certain way. AÓÇùer a while, that phraseology begins\nto carry an aura of truth all by itself no matter what material it embraces.\n\nÓÅ¢us, you have waiting for your ad‚Äîif it is adapted the right way‚Äîa\nstored believability. A believability re\u0000ex. Which you can tap by adopting\nthis particular publication‚Äôs phraseology when you address its audience.\nLet‚Äôs Look at a Few Examples\nI‚Äôll try to show you the three different ways you can borrow this built-\nup believability:\nFirst, of course, and most obvious, is Format. Each publication has its\nown look. You have your copy. Your job is to merge both of them into a\ncombination that will:\n1. Allow the reader to enter into your ad with the least possible\nmental shiÓÇùing of gears from ‚Äúeditorial‚Äù to ‚Äúadvertisement.‚Äù\n2. Carry along the greatest possible amount of believability through\nevery sentence of the ad.\nI have not discussed layout in this book, because I do not believe\nlayout is nearly as effective as copy in determining the results of your ad.\nHere, however, layout is important. A single change in format can add\n50% to your readership, and your results.\nYour job here, once again, is to approximate as closely as possible the\nformat of the medium in which you are advertising. ÓÅ¢is means, ideally,\nletting them set your ad ‚Ä¶ using their kind of headline-to-body-copy\ntransition ‚Ä¶ using their illustrations, their sub heads, their break-up of\nspace.\nOn the following pages are two ads for the same book on handling\npeople. ÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is an all-purpose, house-set magazine ad that was\nshotgunned over twelve or \u0000ÓÇùeen media. It was mildly successful.\nÓÅ¢e second is the same ad, adapted feature for feature for the Wall\nStreet Journal. It was enormously successful‚Äîso much so that it has been\nrepeated (at the time of this writing) nineteen times, once a month, with\nno drop-off in pull.\nLet‚Äôs look at the changes that give this adapted format such continued\nbelievability:\n1. ÓÅ¢e headline, set by the Journal in Journal type. ÓÅ¢ere is no\ndifference between this old-fashioned, upper-and-lower-case headline\nand any other headline in the editorial content of this issue. ÓÅ¢erefore, it\ndoes not immediately signal the reader: ‚ÄúÓÅ¢is is an ad: beware!‚Äù To have\n\nmade it bolder, or more modern, or in all caps, would simply diminish its\neffectiveness.\n2. ÓÅ¢e sub headlines‚Äîtwo of them, one following directly on the\nother. Very Nineteenth Century, really. Abandoned years ago by 99% of\nall American newspapers. But the Journal uses it, and therefore the ad\nuses the same treatment. And the very fact that it is so unusual, and so\nold-fashioned, makes its adaptation that much more belief-carrying in\nthis context.\n\n\n\n3. ÓÅ¢e two bars directly above and below the \u0000rst sub head. One of\nthose small touches that de\u0000nes individuality. ÓÅ¢e ad would lose some of\n\nits atmosphere without them. And atmosphere (believability, trust) is\nwhat you‚Äôre seeking with these adaptations.\n4. ÓÅ¢e placement of subheads to the extreme leÓÇù of the column.\nAnother minute detail. Bad layout according to the agency art director.\nBut again, in perfect harmony with the format of the editorial content.\n5. ÓÅ¢e line drawing of the author. An ugly rendering. Far less\nattractive than the photograph of the same man in the magazine ad. And\nyet the Journal does not use photographs of the men they picture in their\neditorial columns. And so this ad must do the same, even at the cost of\nharrowing screams of pain from its authors (until they see their royalty\nchecks).\nÓÅ¢us, what has been done by these adaptations, is that a corny, old-\nfashioned, rather ugly advertisement has been developed for this speci\u0000c\nmedium‚Äîwhich has about twice the believability, twice the pulling\npower, and twice the staying power of the same exact copy and\nillustration presented the mass-produced way.\nIs it worth the extra cost? Yes. Should it be done for each important\nmedium in turn? Yes.\nWhy? Because in so doing, you are tapping the ingrained trust that\nthe reader has for each medium in turn, and channeling at least part of it,\nunconsciously, onto your product.\nÓÅ¢is, then, is the \u0000rst method of borrowing this built-in believability:\nadopting format.\nÓÅ¢e Second Way to Borrow Believability\nÓÅ¢e second‚Äîslightly less speci\u0000c‚Äîis adopting phraseology.\nÓÅ¢is method stems from the fact that certain media, or classes of\nmedia, use certain stereotyped phrases over and over again, which aÓÇùer a\nwhile take on a believability of their own.\nIn newspapers, to take the most obvious example, there is usually an\nissue date, a city of origin, and perhaps a by-line. Each of these news-\nindicators may be picked up by the copy writer to add believability to his\nopening, as in this extremely successful example:\nSKIN SPECIALIST DEMONSTRATES HOW\nTO RINSE AWAY YOUR BLACKHEADS\nBy Claire Hoffman\n\nNew York, N.Y.‚ÄîA leading doctor today showed an\naudience of men, women and skin-troubled teenagers\nhow to clean oily skin and shrink enlarged pores with a 10-\nminute home medical treatment he has perfected‚Ä¶\nAnd so on. ÓÅ¢e news tone has been set by the opening phrases. ÓÅ¢e\nentire remainder of the copy has been given the atmosphere of a report\nrather than a sales story by these \u0000rst few sentences.\nÓÅ¢e same principle can be used for each of the other classes of media\nyou employ. In direct mail, look for the key correspondence your\nprospect receives that are opened instantly without exception. Some\nexamples would be refund checks, government correspondence, dividend\nnotices, con\u0000dential reports, high-priced newsletters, etc.\nIn radio and TV, adopt the news format and the news phraseology.\nEven, if possible, adopt the news ‚Äúsound‚Äù‚Äîthe clipped phrase of the\nnewscaster, the insider tone of the analyst, the documentary feel of the\nnews, hand-held camera.\nStudy the channels of communication that people believe in. Adopt\ntheir tone, their feel, their style, their sincerity. Make your ads blend in, so\nthere is no jarring transition. Camou\u0000age them.\nBelievability-Borrowing Strategy #3\nIn a later chapter, we‚Äôll deal with mood directly. However, as the last\nmethod of borrowing believability, I want to mention two mood\nadaptations that rightly belong in this discussion. We‚Äôve seen that you\nborrow your publications format and your publications phraseology or\nstyle. ÓÅ¢ese two methods of adding con\u0000dence to your copy depend\ndirectly on the particular medium you are using at am particular\nmoment.\nYou pick up that publications appearance and idiom, as it were,\nbecause people have come to contrast that editorial manner of\npresentation with ‚Äúadvertising language‚Äù in general and because they\nautomatically trust the \u0000rst, and automatically approach the second with\nan ingrained skepticism.\nIn other words, advertising language, which is a more naturally-\nbiased language and emotionally-charged language, tends to produce a\ncounter-reaction in its prospects by its very appearance.\n\nTo overcome this instant and automatic skepticism‚Äîbesides\nborrowing our host publications idiom‚Äîwe also have two other idioms\nwhich allow us to escape the ‚Äúhard-sell‚Äù stereotype.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is Understatement. Simplicity. A lack of color words. Fewer\nadjectives than the reader would expect to superlatives. Short sentences,\nthat fall rather than rise in tone at their end.\nFor example, take any Volkswagen ad. Count the number of nouns\nper sentence, and compare it to the number of adjectives. See how the ad\nkids itself‚Äînever takes itself too seriously. Notice how it makes its point\nquietly, and then stops. Even how the extremely short, extremely simple\nsentence structure adds to the reeling of sincerity.\nHere is a complete Volkswagen ad, which features one superiority of\nthe car over competitive models. Could you have told the story as well,\neven if you used ten times as many words?\nYou never run out of air.\nYou also won‚Äôt have am worries about draining or\nflushing the radiator in spring. There is no radiator.\nOr hoses.\nOr water pump.\nOr rust.\nAnd so there are no worries about anti-freeze in the\nfall or cracked blocks in the winter.\nIf you feel that you owe your Volkswagen engine a\nlittle something special every spring and fall, you can do\nthis much.\nJust run it once around the block and let it air itself out.\nÓÅ¢is is great copy because of its simplicity and its image and its sell,\nall of which interact to give a very powerful argument to anyone looking\nfor a new car.\nAlso, I‚Äôd suggest that you study any of the old Claude Hopkins ads, or\nJohn E. Kennedy (from the old Lord & ÓÅ¢omas days) to get the same\npower of sincerity without the limiting whimsy. Or the great radio and\nTV pitches of the FiÓÇùies.\nÓÅ¢ere is little advertising being written this way, and its very rarity\nmakes it even more effective. It will not solve every selling problem, but\nwhere it is effective‚Äîespecially in continuous campaigns‚Äîit is very\neffective indeed.\n\nÓÅ¢e second mood you may employ to break away from the\n‚Äúadvertising‚Äù stereotype is what I call Deadly Sincerity. ÓÅ¢is is the\ntechnique of leaning over backwards to point out the \u0000aws in an offer, so\nthat the bene\u0000ts, when you bring them in, will be believed that much\nmore deeply.\nSince this is not done in ordinary advertising‚Äîsince ordinary copy\ndoes not knock its product as well as praise it‚Äîit carries great emotional\nimpact, especially in highly-competitive \u0000elds. Here is an example, for a\nbook on getting ahead on your job, which had to run aÓÇùer a hundred\nbooks on the same subject had already appeared in the same publication:\nTO THE MAN WHO WILL SETTLE FOR\nNOTHING LESS THAN THE PRESIDENCY OF\nHIS FIRM\nAnd who is willing to make the incredible sacrifices\nnecessary to get there in the shortest possible time.\nHere is the most realistic handbook ever written for\nyou‚Äîand you alone.\nThis is a private advertisement.\nIt is not meant for ninety-nine men out of every\nhundred. These men do not have the drive‚Äîthe\nimpossible pride‚Äîthe absolute compulsion to succeed\nthat this advertisement demands ‚Ä¶\nAnd so on. You can see immediately, in the \u0000rst few paragraphs of\nthis ad, how the tone of utter frankness is set. ÓÅ¢e use of such ‚Äúnon-\nadvertising phraseology‚Äù as ‚Äúincredible sacri\u0000ce‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äúimpossible pride‚Äù‚Ä¶\n‚Äúabsolute compulsion‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthis advertisement demands‚Äù set the ad off from\nthe others around it‚Äîgive it an air of unpredictability that induces the\nreader to go on.\nIn our next chapter when we discuss Reinforcement, we shall see how\nthis tone of complete fairness, and even criticism, can make a\ncomparatively minor claim take on immense emotional impact. But for\nnow it is sufficient to point out that this is one more way to break out of\nthe hard-sell stereotype, and gain almost the same type of believability\nthat would be given to a factual report.\n\n9 - THE FINAL TOUCHES\nLet‚Äôs now review what we‚Äôve done up to this point, and the last few\nproblems that we have to consider.\nWe started this book with the idea that there was a de\u0000nite technique\nthat could produce better headlines than the ones you were using\nyesterday. And. since the headline is so vitally important to the success or\nfailure of your ads, we devoted the \u0000rst part of our book to this creative\nsearch.\nÓÅ¢en, in the second part, we investigated the equally important\nproblem of how to exploit that headline. How to lead the prospect from\nthe feeding of interest and curiosity that your headline had aroused in\nhim, into a constantly mounting conviction that this product has what he\nwants, and that it is absolutely capable of giving it to him.\nYou use body copy to accomplish this second objective‚Äîperhaps a lot\nof it, perhaps very little. In either case, we‚Äôve examined the three\ninterlocking paths by which this effective demand is created: \u0000rst, the\nintensi\u0000cation of desire; then the creation of an acceptable product\npersonality or role with which the prospect will want to identify; and then\nthe rather abstract structure underlying your copy arrangement that\nproduces believability of your story.\nSo now we‚Äôve seen how to reach out to your prospects mind on all\nthree emotional levels: Desire ‚Ä¶ Identi\u0000cation ‚Ä¶ and Believability.\nNow, as our last problem, we have to put all these elements together.\nWe have to take all these promises, these images, these devices, these\nstructures‚Äîand weave them together into one cohesive unit, that holds\nyour prospect‚Äôs attention from beginning to end.\nIn other words, having broken down the ad to analyze the elements\nthat make it work‚Äîwe now have to deal with the reverse problem: tying\nit together once again.\nWe have several additional devices that help us do this. We‚Äôve already\ntouched on them in passing in previous chapters. Now let‚Äôs examine them\nmore closely see what makes them operate, formalize them into working\nrules. Like this:\nVeri\u0000cation‚ÄîHow to Offer Authorities and Proof\nNow, of course, comes the most obvious kind of believability copy.\nYour proof: your statistics; your tests; your testimonials: your authorities;\n\nyour trends; your documentation; your seals of approval; your awards\nwon. Any fact at all that you can use, anywhere in the copy, to show that\nyour product does what you says it does.\nÓÅ¢e key words here are anywhere in your copy. Because, as I have tried\nto show in the last four chapters, the placement of your proof is as\nimportant to its overall effect as the content itself.\nI can‚Äôt tell you anything about gathering proof that your own research\ndepartment doesn‚Äôt know a hundred times better. Or, if you have no\nresearch department, that good hard digging won‚Äôt give you.\nÓÅ¢ere are no special rules to phrasing proof‚Äîexcept, perhaps, to keep\nit as short as possible, as dramatic as possible, as speci\u0000c as possible.\nAnd, above all, remember that proof copy, like every other word in\nyour ad, is selling copy. It cannot merely offer proof alone. It must offer\nthe kind of proof that makes the prospect hungry to read every word of it,\nand it must make him want the product more and more at the end of\nevery line.\nFine. But the next question is: where do you place the proof in your\nad? At what point or points will it be most effective?\nAnd, next, how many different proofs or tests or testimonials or what-\nhave-you should you include in the ad? When do you put them in, and\nwhen (if ever) do you leave them out? When do they make the ad too\nheavy? When do they make it dull? When do they make it too much to be\nbelieved?\nWe have been discussing these questions, though not in this context,\nfor the last four chapters. For the last four chapters we have been\ndiscussing the placement and structure of claims, of promises. We have\nfound that the more you prepare for those claims, and the more agreeable\nyou have made your reader to accepting them, the more powerful they\nbecome.\nÓÅ¢e same exact rules hold for your proof. Proof‚Äîlike claims‚Äîis most\neffective when the reader unconsciously demands it, and when he is ready\nto accept its content as necessary and logical.\nÓÅ¢is is the rule. As simple and concrete as this. All the rest is\napplication.\nWe‚Äôve gone over, quite carefully, the four processes that determine\nposition in your ad. ÓÅ¢ey are, once again:\n1. Gradualization‚Äîthe development of a stream of acceptances from\nyour reader to your statements, leading \u0000nally to an inevitable demand\n\non the part of that reader for your product.\n2. Rede\u0000nition‚Äîthe removal of preconceived objections on the part of\nyour prospect toward your product, by providing him with a new\nde\u0000nition of that product.\n3. Mechanization‚Äîthe verbal proof that your product works‚Äîthat it\ndoes what you say it does.\n4. Concentration‚Äîthe verbal proof that other alternate products do\nnot do this essential function as well.\nNow, every one of these processes is effective, not only in increasing\nthe believability of your claims, but also in increasing the believability of\nyour proof.\nAnd, in exactly the same way, in every one of these processes, there is\na place for your proof to appear where it will do twice as much good for\nyour copy as it would anywhere else.\nFor example, go back and look at the Concentration copy in the spark\nplug ad that we analyzed in Chapter 12. Here was a point-aÓÇùer-point\ncomparison of the weaknesses of spark plugs contrasted with similar\nstrengths in \u0000re injectors.\nAt the end of this sequence, the writer had built up tremendous\nbelievability. He could have done many things with that believability. He\ncould have switched it into an immediate restatement of his main claims.\nHe could have channeled it directly into asking for the order. He could\nhave gone into a money back guarantee, etc.\nInstead, he chose to pile proof upon believability in this way: ‚ÄúÓÅ¢ese\nare some of the reasons that the U.S. Air Force pays premium prices for\nsurface supported injectors for their aircraÓÑó ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nAnd, in so doing, strengthens the power of both the believability copy\nthat went before, and the authority-reference that now follows.\nÓÅ¢us, and we‚Äôll take this up in greater detail in the Reinforcement\nsection that follows, in copy 1 + 1 can oÓÑóen equal 10. By adding one\npowerful piece of copy‚Äîat precisely the right moment‚Äîto another, you\ncan get an overall effect far greater than these two pieces of copy would\never produce, if they were just spread out all over the page.\nPosition increases power. We continue to \u0000nd new examples of this\nevery time we explore another copy process.\nAnd how about the other three processes? How does your proof\ninteract with them?\n\nWell, take Gradualization. Study the TV Repair Manual ad again.\nNotice the exact point that the ‚Äò‚Äúmanufacturer‚Äôs test rooms‚Äù are brought\ninto the copy‚Äîat the very moment that the reader is begging for some sort\nof solution to the problems that the copy has intensi\u0000ed over and over\nagain.\nHere, at this point, the reader is searching for an answer. Here the\nexact same proof which might be merely dull statistics if it were presented\nearlier, suddenly takes on a sharpened drama‚Äîbecause the reader now is\nfully aware of its importance, and is ready to explore every word.\nAgain, I must repeat that the main problem with documentation is\nthat it is inherently dull. Your job, therefore, is to add excitement to it.\nYou have to stage it. You have to develop a drama, in your reader‚Äôs mind,\ninto which your documentation enters as the hero. In which statistics\nsuddenly become charged with emotion‚Äîbecause you‚Äôve made them the\nsolution to whatever stands between your reader and the satisfactions that\nhe craves.\nI could go on, and give examples of the interaction of proof and each\nof the remaining mechanisms, but I think you would gain far more by\ndoing it yourself. Instead, let me sum up by saying this:\nDocumentation is any sort of proof‚Äîstatistics, facts, tests, etc.‚Äîthat\nyour product works.\nMechanization on the other hand (in case there may be a confusion in\nyour mind) is the verbal and logical demonstration, and thus also proof,\nthat your product works. Mechanization does not necessarily have to\nincorporate any outside documentation at all to prove its point‚Äîit does\nthis on the strength of its logic and its structure alone.\nVeri\u0000cation‚Äîwhich is different from both of them‚Äîis the process of\narranging your documentation within your copy so that it gains the\ngreatest immediate acceptance from your reader, and has the greatest\nemotional effect on him.\nÓÅ¢us, I would suggest that you stop thinking of placing your\ndocumentation only in the headline of your ad, or in the sub-head, or in a\nseparate box labelled. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs Proof.‚Äù\nI would suggest instead that you start thinking of documentation as\none more element (along with promises, belief-words, momentum-\nbuilders, image-sharpeners, emotion-de\u0000ners, and all the rest which we‚Äôll\nexplore before we \u0000nish) to be interwoven together, side by side‚Äîso that,\n\ncombined, they give you far greater emotional power and believability\nthan any one of them could separately.\nReinforcement‚ÄîHow to Make Two\nClaims Do the Work of Four\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst rule of all copy, of course, is that it produce an emotional\nimpact. As we have seen, over and over again, even in believability copy,\neven in documentation, every word must carry image, picture, feeling.\nNow, the wonderful thing about emotional writing, of which copy is\none form, is this: ÓÅ¢at if you employ it skillfully, then the impact of one\nemotion, plus the impact of a second emotion, will oÓÇùen add up‚Äînon-\nmathematically‚Äîto the impact of FOUR emotions.\nIn mathematics, one plus one always equals two‚Äînever more. In\nemotional writing, one plus one can oÓÇùen equal ten. In other words, two\nemotional images, joined together in the right way can oÓÑóen have TEN\nTIMES the impact that either of these images has by itself.\nFor example, in the classic Avis campaign, the main theme was ‚ÄúWe\ntry harder.‚Äù Good by itself; but nowhere near as powerful as it became\nwhen it was reinforced by the reason why Avis tries harder: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only\nsecond.‚Äù\nÓÅ¢ese two separate ideas: (1) We‚Äôre second; (2) ÓÇªerefore, we try\nharder.‚Äîwhen they are combined, take on a joint impact far greater than\nyou could ever logically expect if you simply examined each one of them\nby itself.\nIn fact, we can even de\u0000ne one type of creativity as the ability to\ncombine separate images into a new identity that is much more powerful\nthan the mere logical sum of its parts.\nÓÅ¢is is how new words are born. As well as new phrases, slogans,\nconcepts, ideas. And, of course, headlines.\nYour job‚Äîand it‚Äôs a tough one‚Äîis to do just this, image by image,\nthroughout the entire body copy of your ad.\nFor example, in the ad for ‚Äúthe man who will settle for nothing less\nthan the presidency of his \u0000rm‚Äô‚Äô that we quoted in the last chapter, this\nsequence occurs:\nThis is John Horn‚Äôs first book, he is not an\naccomplished writer, and it has flaws. If you read for style,\n\nor for literary quality this is not your book.\nBui there are paragraphs in his book‚Äîideas in this\nhook‚Äîwhole chapters in this book which have never been\nput down on paper before that may open doors to you‚Äî\ntomorrow‚Äîthat otherwise might take a lifetime of waiting\nfor you to walk through!\nNotice how the startling frankness of the \u0000rst paragraph, which goes\nout of its way to call the reader‚Äôs attention to \u0000aws in its product, serves as\nan intensifying contrast to the positive claims of the second paragraph‚Äî\nmaking them far more believable and therefore far more powerful to the\nreader who is now convinced that he is receiving a fair report on this\nbook.\nIt is the juxtaposition of these two paragraphs‚Äîone following right on\ntop of the other‚Äîthat makes their combination so effective.\nCopywriting, in many phases, is the search for such juxtapositions.\nÓÅ¢e last \u0000ve chapters have been full of examples of them. I suggest that\nyou go back and read these examples again, and underline the\ncombination points‚Äîand junctures‚Äîwhere one claim blends into\nanother, and either sharpens it, pours strength into it, or makes it more\nbelievable.\nSo, one way you tie your ad together is to constantly build one claim\non top of another‚Äîalways seeking to make each stronger and more\nbelievable by the combination.\nÓÅ¢is same principle applies in a smaller way in our next device.\nInterweaving‚ÄîHow to Blend Emotion, Image\nand Logic Into the Same Sentence\nLet me mention at this point a thought that has probably occurred to\nyou several times over the past few chapters:\nÓÅ¢e big trouble with analysis of the kind we‚Äôve been doing in the\nsecond part of this book is that aÓÇùer a while it begins to sound quite\nmechanical. You‚Äôve probably thought that I‚Äôm suggesting that you\nabandon any kind of creative \u0000ow, and work like a sort of phrase-\ncarpenter. Here you put in a promise; there you nail on a believability\nsentence; then cover both of them with a good strong identi\u0000cation.\n\nÓÅ¢is is what it sounds like because it takes so long to identify each one\nof these devices and show you how to work them. Because of this need\nfor analysis‚Äîwhich always requires that you cut individual elements out\nof the ‚Äúlife-\u0000ow‚Äù of a growing ad‚Äîit sounds like you should actually be\nconscious of each device as you are using it to write that ad‚Äîeven going\nso far as to name the device as you weave it in.\nI don‚Äôt think I have to tell you that this mechanical approach is not my\nidea, and that it won‚Äôt work. What I‚Äôm trying to do is exactly the same\nprocedure that a golf pro uses when he wants to improve your game. He\ndoesn‚Äôt just let you go out and play. He stops you, makes you notice your\nhands, rationalize your grip, shiÓÇù your \u0000ngers, get used to the new feel of\nthe club as you liÓÇù it this new way, and then take a few practice swings‚Äî\nall at the same time that he‚Äôs telling you why you‚Äôre doing it this way.\nWhen you‚Äôre swinging for the \u0000rst few times, this new way, you feel\npretty awkward, and you‚Äôre conscious of every muscle in your arms.\nÓÅ¢at‚Äôs why he has you keep swinging‚Äîthrough one bucket‚Ä¶ two buckets\n‚Ä¶ ten buckets of balls.\nPretty soon, though, those arm muscles are going to feel comfortable\nin that new swing. And you‚Äôre going to lose your conscious awareness of\nthem. At that point, what was mechanical before becomes intuitive now.\nBut it‚Äôs a new kind of intuition‚Äîfar more, skillful and effective than you\nhad before.\nÓÅ¢is is the kind of intuition I‚Äôm trying to build in you. I‚Äôm trying to\ntake you from Creativity #1 to Creativity #2. Both are intuitive states,\nwhere you write from the full depths of your emotions as well as your\nmind, and when you are no more conscious of the mechanisms and\ndevices that you are employing to gain your effects, than you are of the\nmovements of your \u0000ngers on the typewriter keys.\nBut, to get you from State #1 to State #2. 1 have to bring all these\ndetails to consciousness‚Äîand make you awkward in a new and more\neffective way than you were when you \u0000rst learned to write copy‚Äîso that\nyou can take these insights and techniques and bury them inside your\nown talent‚Äîso that you can automatically employ them, without\nthinking about them at all, when you want to express most powerfully\nyour ideas, your emotions and your sales philosophy.\nÓÅ¢is whole process of ‚ÄúNew Awkwardness leading to New Ability‚Äù is\nseen quite clearly in the very simple technique of Interweaving, which I\nlearned from a brilliant man by the name of Walter S. Campbell.\n\nEvery copy writer should read Campbell‚Äôs book, Writing Non-Fiction\n(ÓÅ¢e Writer, Inc., 1961). In the next chapter I‚Äôll list other books you\nshould have. But this is certainly one of the important ones that you can\nprobably master in a weekend.\nCampbell is talking about reporting and not copy writing, but the\nstructural principles are the same. He says that even in the most factual\nreporting, no sentence can be effective if it contains only the facts alone. It\nmust also contain emotion, evaluation, impact‚Äîif those facts are to be\ngiven meaning and importance to the reader.\nÓÅ¢e same is true for every sentence you write of copy. ÓÅ¢at sentence\nshould contain not only promise ‚Ä¶ not only image not only logic‚Äîbut as\nmuch of all three as possible.\nWeave together your promise, your logic, your emotion, your image.\nPack your sentences full of every one of them. Make them blend into each\nother, till it‚Äôs almost impossible to pull out the individual threads of the\nrich pattern of conviction and desire you‚Äôre weaving.\nFor example, go back to the \u0000re injector ad in Chapter 12, and see\nhow promise is interwoven in even sentence of the believability copy\nwhere the injectors are being contrasted with the old-fashioned plugs. In\nthese two sentences, for instance:\n‚ÄúWith ordinary spark plugs you are using, or should he using premium\ngas (disadvantage) which costs from 4 to 8 cents more than ordinary gas\n(disadvantage), and despite this (disadvantage) you‚Äôre getting inefficient\n(disadvantage), wasteful (disadvantage) gas consumption (disadvantage).‚Äù\nIn this \u0000rst sentence, which is part of a logical sequence offered as\nproof of superiority through comparison of performance characteristics,\nthe copy writer has managed to insert six disadvantage-images for the\nreader to remember the next time he considers buying ordinary plugs.\nNow the copy writer goes on to his contrasting sentence about the\ninjectors:\n‚ÄúWith \u0000re injectors regular gas (promise) will give you up to 8 miles\nmore per gallon (promise), up to 31 more horsepower (promise), plus\neasier starting (promise) in all weather (promise).‚Äù\nFive promises in this second sentence. ÓÅ¢e packing in of image upon\nimage to build an overwhelming effect.\nOr, as an even more complicated example, involving the interweaving\nof almost every copy element in the book, let‚Äôs look at this sentence:\n\n‚ÄúAnd, most important, (a mood-builder, indicating the value to the\nreader of the promises which are about to follow) these experts (reference\nto authority to build believability) have discovered (more believability\nthrough the use of the scienti\u0000c idiom) that you do not have to be a\nhandyman (the core-promise) or a mechanic (restatement of the core-\npromise) in order to coax (promise of ease) this performance (promise,\ncondensing all the claims of superior reception that have already been\ndetailed in the previous copy) out of your set.‚Äù\nNow, is this done consciously? Not at all. But the copy writer knew\nthe principle of interest-building, has experimented with it before ‚Ä¶ and\nhad it stored away in his unconscious as one more tool to be used‚Äî\nintuitively‚Äîto bring in the effect he wanted, at the exact moment he\nneeded it.\nTry it yourself. See how many different emotions you can pack into a\nsingle sentence ‚Ä¶ paragraph ‚Ä¶ sequence. See how much richer and\nmore powerful your copy becomes. How much more you can say in the\nsame space. How you begin to build reinforcement-multiplied impact\ninto more and more of your copy.\nSensitivity‚ÄîHow to Give Your Reader What He\nDemands Step In Step ÓÅ¢roughout the Copy\nNow; if you continue to pile promise upon promise, identi\u0000cation\nupon identi\u0000cation, documentation upon documentation, element upon\nelement‚Ä¶ where do you stop? Where does it become too much? Where does\nthe reader become satiated or bored and want to go on to a new image or\nnew promise, or even the close?\nAt what point are you starting to oversell? How do you catch yourself,\nand switch off?\nWe have already touched on this problem before in Chapter 11. I\nsuggest that you reread that discussion now, even though we‚Äôre going to\nexpand on it at this point.\nHere you are relying on your own powers of empathy. You must be, at\nthe same time, not only the writer of your ad but its reader. You must\nanticipate that point in the copy \u0000ow‚Äîas it is transformed into a series of\nimpressions in your readers mind‚Äîwhere he is going to say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read\nenough about this. Give me this instead.‚Äù\n\nAnd then you must shiÓÇù the direction of the copy to meet his new\ndirection of interest.\nIn other words, what we are talking about now is the overall structure\nof your ad. Not a sentence, or a paragraph, or a sequence: but the\narchitecture of the ad as a whole.\nEvery ad has an architecture, as I‚Äôm sure YOU know. ÓÅ¢is is the\noverall pattern of the ad, including when and where and how many times\nyou shiÓÇù from one type of copy to another. It is the ability to recognize\nthese shiÓÇù points, and to change when YOU encounter them from‚Äîsay\n‚Äîpromise copy to mechanism copy to documentation copy to promise\ncopy again, that makes your ad stick together, or fall apart.\nÓÅ¢is is an almost impossible skill to communicate, since it relies so\nmuch on the feel of each individual situation. However, I can show it to\nYOU aÓÑóer it‚Äôs occurred, in a series of four ads on the same general type of\nproduct‚Äîbooks‚Äîand how each differs from the others in the way large\nblocks of copy elements are blended in and out of the overall sell.\nAs I‚Äôve said before, I use mail order as my example because mail order\nis the longest general form of copy, because it usually sells the hardest,\nand because the techniques I‚Äôm talking about are usually outlined most\nclearly in this type of copy.\nLet‚Äôs look at our four ads, and see how each approaches the basic task\nof selling a similar product in a different way and with a different blend of\nelements:\nSample Ad #1\nÓÅ¢is is the friend-winning ad we looked at in our last chapter. I‚Äôve\nindicated each major block of copy, in sequence, by a letter of the\nalphabet; and each of the shiÓÇù points by a number. I am using as\nexamples all direct-promise headlines. ÓÅ¢e promise in this headline is\nalmost universal (A): that you can make anybody like YOU.\nInstead of intensifying the promise immediately, however, as many\nother ads in this category have done, this copy starts out by restating the\noriginal headline promise (making anybody like you becomes popularity)\nand by de\u0000ning the previously unrecognized fact that this popularity can\nbe taught. (B).\nWhy was this done? For two reasons: (1) because this novel, almost\nparadoxical rede\u0000nition (Can popularity be purchased?) established an\n\nimmediate point of difference between this book and the dozens of\nsimilar titles that had come before it always a critical problem. And (2)\nbecause this ad‚Äôs subject was a teacher, and the ad‚Äôs whole believability\nrested upon the fact that so many large and respected corporations had\npaid this man so much money to reach these techniques to their\nemployees.\nÓÅ¢is is established by the ads \u0000rst shiÓÇù point and \u0000rst transitional\nsentence (1). ‚ÄúÓÇªis has been proved by ‚Ä¶‚Äù leads directly into the \u0000rst\ndocumentation block in which the corporations are named.\nÓÅ¢us we have the developing pattern of the ad as:\nPromise\nDe\u0000nition\nDocumentation ‚Ä¶\nRight up to the next transition sentence (2), which brings in the \u0000rst\ndetailed promise block (D), and which then echoes again the\ndocumentation (E) and price comparison.\nNow, aÓÇùer a brief transitional promise (F), the ad de\u0000nes again the\nimportance of the over-all promise (G), backs it up with a third\nrestatement of the documentation (H), and then states directly the price\ncomparison and money-back guarantee (I).\nÓÅ¢en, with the classic transition (3), it goes on to devote the rest of\nthe ad to a detailed cataloguing of the promise (J). A recitation of\npromises that are far stronger now‚Äîbecause of the preparation of\nde\u0000nition and documentation that has been laid for them, than they\nwould have ever been had they simply been put at the beginning of the ad\nwithout such preparation.\nIncidentally, notice how the negative promises (K), and the full list of\ndocumentation (L), have been placed out of the main stream of the ad\nwhere they can be read, or not read, by those who are interested in them.\n\n\n\nSample Ad #2\nAn ad for a book on improving the power of your mind. Again the\npromise-headline (A), intensi\u0000ed by‚Äîthis time‚Äîan elaboration of this\npromise (B). (See page 212.)\nNow, using its \u0000rst transitional sentence (1), the ad moves into two\nparagraphs of negative (C) and positive (D) rede\u0000nition. And then, with\na single transition-word (Simply‚Äî2), again elaborates the promise,\nmaking it stronger and stronger and more and more detailed, and at the\nsame time giving it the believability-tone of de\u0000nition.\nÓÅ¢is de\u0000nition-tone is unchanged throughout (F), where promise is\nagain interwoven with fact, leading immediately into a transition (3) in\nwhich the tone is that of proof, but the content is straight promise (G).\nÓÅ¢en this proof is connected (4) with the entire promise catalog (H)\nwhich \u0000lls the rest of the ad.\nÓÅ¢is ad‚Äîenormously successful‚Äîis one of the best examples of\ninterweaving we have. ÓÅ¢ere is so subtle a blending here of de\u0000nition,\ndocumentation and promise, that every word of the copy soon takes on\nthe aura of pure fact.\n\n\n\nSample Ad #3\nNow we move on to the straight-promise ad. ÓÅ¢is is the rock-em,\nsock-em type, dominated by promise and mechanism-promise, which\ngains its power from the sheer momentum and relentlessness of its\nclaims. (See page 216.)\nIt again starts with the over-all promise (A), which it immediately\nfollows up with a second, elaborating promise (B).\n\nÓÅ¢en it moves directly into its fundamental de\u0000nition (C), which it\nequates in a single phrase (then you could‚Äî1) with a greatly detailed\npromise (D), and then follows up with a beautifully condensed paragraph\nwhich consists of a transition in (2) to a restatement of its fundamental\nrede\u0000nition (E), and out again (3) to the remainder of the ad. (F), which\nis sheer promise and promise-mechanism from then on.\nHere, documentation is disregarded entirely. ÓÅ¢e full weight of the\nsale depends on the power and momentum of the promise-train.\n\nSample Ad #4\nAnd \u0000nally, we have a beauty book. Here, the main promise-headline\n(B) is preceded by the critical authority-reference (A) which: \u0000rst, sets it\napart from the other similar products it must erase from the prospects\nmind: and second, brings in immediately the key persuader of its author.\n(See page 220.)\n(C) block, while promise copy, also serves the simultaneous purpose\nof being a momentum-builder‚Äîa technique we will discuss in a moment.\n\nUsing the different type faces and sizes as transitional elements, the\ncopy then introduces its crucial concentration copy (D), in which it\nrede\u0000nes what the woman can now expect from her appearance, and in\nwhich it outdates other approaches to giving this ful\u0000llment to her.\nAÓÇùer (1) Because‚Ä¶ comes the \u0000rst promise-elaboration block.\nBut there is no piling up of claim upon claim here. ÓÅ¢ere is too much\ningrained skepticism in this prospect‚Äîtoo much awareness of other,\nprevious claims that have disappointed her in the past. ÓÅ¢is skepticism\nmust be anticipated, and answered. ÓÅ¢is is done, \u0000rst (F) by agreeing with\nit, and then (G) by shiÓÇùing the entire story onto the doctor for twelve\nparagraphs‚Äîby far the longest reference to authority of any of our four\nsample ads.\nÓÅ¢en a transition (2) back to promise (H), which \u0000lls out the rest of\nthe ad.\n\n\n\nSee How the Structure Differs\nLet me say this. Although I have not pointed out every transition, nor\nevery blending of different types of copy, I have, 1 hope, given you\nenough material to see clearly how ads differ in overall structure, as they\ndiffer in content, as the demands of their material differ.\nÓÅ¢ey range from the simplest promise-elaboration (example 3), to the\nmost subtle blending of all the various elements of desire, image, proof,\n\nde\u0000nition and what have you (example 2), to the most complicated\npromise-and-proof‚Ä¶ promise-and-proof reinforcement (example 4).\nEach problem demands a different structure. Each signals as you\nwrite it, that here‚Äîat this precise point‚Äîyour copy has leÓÑó your reader.\nYou have gone on straight when lie wants to turn leÓÇù. You are piling on\npromise aÓÇùer promise, when lie no longer believes you. You are burying\nhim under a sea of statistics, when he is convinced you are telling the\ntruth, and wants you to make those delicious promises all over again.\nÓÅ¢is is what you feel when you are writing the ad. Probably a kind of\nirritating confusion. A blockage. A sense that the copy has suddenly gone\ndead, and all you are writing now is words.\nSo you stop, and think, and look for a new direction. I hope, in this\nsection, that I have given you a faint indication of what some of these\ndirections might be.\nWhat, on the other hand, can you learn from analyzing the structure\nof your ads (or other writers‚Äô) aÓÇùer you have \u0000nished them?\nPrimarily‚Äîwhat kind of ad you have written. Is it straight promise?\nToo much documentation? Too little de\u0000nition of the new world of\npossibilities your product has created?\nDoes it still sound too much like everyone else‚Äôs copy. Or product?\nCould you put another brand-name on it, and not make any difference?\nHave you leÓÑó anything out? Will this bare promise carry the sale? Or\ncould you increase its impact by paving its way with some mechanism or\nbelievability copy? How about a proof section? A use photo? A fuller\ndescription of the way it works?\nMind you, this is not content alone that ice are discussing. If you take\nthe same content, and give it a new structure, you are going to create a\nnew ad. Try it. See for yourself. If you‚Äôre stuck sometime, throw away\nyour headline, throw away your rough copy \u0000ow, and start off again 180\ndegrees away from where you started before.\nI want to repeat this again: A new structure is a new ad. It brings out\nnew ideas. Gives your promises new sharpness, new \u0000avor, new\nbelievability and even begins to create whole new sections that you never\ndreamed were there in the product before. So we‚Äôve come full circle. You\nstart your ad by creating your headline. You develop your copy story\nfrom that headline. But if the copy story doesn‚Äôt develop‚Äîif you gradually\n\u0000nd that the headline isn‚Äôt really that good aÓÇùer all‚Äîthen perhaps the very\n\nelements that are begging to come out of your 6-point type should be at the\ntop of your ad.\nÓÅ¢is is what makes this copy writing so interesting. You‚Äôre always\nbeing surprised‚Äîwith ideas from the most ungodly places. Just make\nsure you‚Äôve got your eyes open wide enough to catch all of them.\nMomentum‚ÄîHow to Draw Your Reader\nDeeper and Deeper Into Your Copy\nÓÅ¢ere are two other devices we should discuss. Both of them help tie\nyour ad together, though that‚Äôs not their primary function.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst is Momentum. How to draw your reader into your copy ‚Ä¶\nkeep him reading ‚Ä¶ making sure he doesn‚Äôt quit you in the middle.\nCopy‚Äôs \u0000rst job, of course, is to be read. If it‚Äôs not read, it can‚Äôt sell.\nAnd if you take some time to make your points‚Äîto intensify your desire,\nto build and rebuild your believability, to reinforce one claim with\nanother‚Äîthen you‚Äôd better make darn sure that you‚Äôve put plenty of\nmomentum-builders into your copy\nÓÅ¢ere are two types:\n1. Actual momentum phrases; and\n2. Incomplete statements, or teasers, that draw the reader further into\nthe copy in order to complete them.\nÓÅ¢e \u0000rst type, the momentum-phrases, are time-honored. ÓÅ¢ey are\nused in almost any sort of persuasive or educational writing. You insert\nthem in your copy primarily in your transition-sentences, to keep interest\nfrom \u0000agging, to indicate to your reader the general type of material that‚Äôs\ngoing to follow. ÓÅ¢ey are ‚Äúaddy,‚Äù but they work. Here are a few examples,\ntaken from the four book ads we looked at in the last section:\n‚ÄúThey paid up to $22.50 a person to learn priceless\ntechniques like these:‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou can learn them all, in your own home next\nweekend, without risking a penny. Here‚Äôs how‚Äù\n‚ÄúHere is the information you will find in this hook.‚Äù\n‚ÄúLet me explain.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll I ask from you is this.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat you are going to do, in the very first hour that\nyou receive the book, is this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd yet it‚Äôs only the beginning.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTHEN put this simple trick to work for you‚Äîthat VERY\nSAME HOUR‚Äù\n‚ÄúFor example‚Äî‚Äù\n‚ÄúRead the thrilling answer below.‚Äù\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ to start with ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúJust wait till you try this.‚Äù\nAnd so on. ÓÅ¢ese are actual invitations to read on. If YOU write long\ncopy, they should be spotted throughout it.\nÓÅ¢e second category of momentum-builder is much more subtle, and\ngives YOU thousands of ways to keep drawing your reader along aÓÇùer\nyour developing thought. It‚Äôs based on the simple principle that if YOU\nmake a statement that interests your reader, and if you purposely and\nskillfully do not complete that statement, so that there is a question of\nhow it can be done, then he will read on to \u0000nd out more.\nIn other words, YOU are continually throughout the copy:\n1. Creating interest in a speci\u0000c point;\n2. Raising a question in his mind about that point; and\n3. Implying an answer to that question later in the copy.\nHere are some examples of this technique:\n‚ÄúAnd YOU will do it often using nothing more than\nordinary tap water, your own ten fingers, and the contents\nof your garden and your refrigerator.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut now, when you turn on the ignition, a modern\nmiracle of engineering science comes to life underneath your\nhood!‚Äù\n‚ÄúYes! Here at last is the Engineering Miracle you‚Äôve\nbeen hearing rumors about for months. The fantastic\nPower-Booster that Continental millionaires use to soup\nup the performance of $12,000 cars! The revolutionary\nnew Gas-Saver that actually gives compact-car economy\nto Fords. Chevrolets, Plymouths and dozens of other\nAmerican cars now driving in Europe! The sixty-second\nattachment that HAD TO BE BANNED from the great\nEuropean raceways‚Äîbecause it gave so much added\npower, so much added efficiency to any car that used it‚Äî\nthat the officials were forced to rule that it gave these cars\n\nan UNFAIR ADVANTAGE over those drivers who couldn‚Äôt\nobtain it!‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow to Grow Thousands of Flowers‚ÄîWithout\nDirtying Your Hands.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHere it is at last. Authoritative medical proof that men\nin their forties and fifties and sixties can enjoy a sex life in\nmany ways as satisfying as when they were in their\ntwenties‚Äîif they are only shown how to combat the hidden\nforces within their minds and bodies that literally drive them\nimpotent!!‚Äù\n‚ÄúCaught! 120 Fish in One Hour!‚Äù\n‚ÄúJust picture the scene as these college horticulturists\nbegan this amazing flowering test of roses. For here\ngathered in a test field were all the highly-prized queens of\nrosedom ‚Ä¶ rose blends that today sell for as high as $3.75\nfor a single plant. Row upon row of roses ‚Ä¶ prize-winners\nin international competition ‚Ä¶ the best the world has to\noffer ‚Ä¶ AND THEN, NEARLY-WILD STARTED TO\nBLOOM!‚Äù\nAnd so on. ÓÅ¢e objective here is to keep the reader going‚Äîfor one\nmore sentence, one more paragraph, one more sequence. Notice, of\ncourse, that every one of these examples not only produces momentum,\nnot only raises questions in the reader‚Äôs mind that he virtually must read\non to answer‚Äîbut is also, at exactly the same time, loaded with sell.\nAgain, interweaving‚Äîmaking each element in the ad accomplish two\nobjectives. No waste words.\nMood‚ÄîHow to Pack Your Copy With Drama,\nExcitement, Sincerity or Any Other Emotion You\nWish\nNow we come to the matter of words‚Äîand the color which words\ncreate.\nI have given you dozens of different examples in this book of selling\ncopy. All these examples had certain elements in common‚Äîthey were\nstrong, successful, convincing and so on. But, at the same time, each of\nthese copy blocks differed from the others in one immediately apparent\n\nway‚Äîin the mood that each set, simply by the rhythm and words that the\ncopy writer used to express his thoughts.\nWords and rhythms. ÓÅ¢ey are to the copy writer what line and color\nare to the painter. ÓÅ¢ey set the mood of your story‚Äîcarry the emotion so\nsubtly that your reader never really realizes where the excitement or the\nimage or the conviction is actually coming from.\nFor example, here are several of the passages we‚Äôve looked at before.\nNow let‚Äôs italicize the mood-builders within them, that make each so\ndifferent from the others:\nObjective: to emphasize color, beauty, excitement, visual image:\nAnd when that third precious ingredient reaches those\nbuds‚Äîthen that very morning you will open the door to\nyour house‚ÄîAND YOU WILL BE BLINDED BY THE\nEXPLOSION OF COLOR THAT GREETS YOU IN YOUR\nGARDEN! ‚Ä¶ You will see rose bushes weighted down by\nmasses of blossoms, of a richness and perfume and color\nyou have never imagined before! You will walk past solid,\nblazing rows of chrysanthemums so thick that you can‚Äôt\neven see a leaf in between‚Ä¶\nNotice that you don‚Äôt even distinguish many of the separate images\nuntil they are called to your attention. Notice also that some of the words\nare primarily visual image-sharpeners (weighted down ‚Ä¶ solid, blazing\nrows ‚Ä¶ so thick you can‚Äôt even see a leaf in between). While others\nconvey, not image, but emotion (precious ‚Ä¶ that very morning ‚Ä¶\nblinded ‚Ä¶ greets ‚Ä¶ you never imagined before).\nÓÅ¢ese words are emotion-de\u0000ners. ÓÅ¢ey tell the reader what to feel\nabout the images and ideas you are presenting to him. ÓÅ¢eir very essence\nis that they are so subtle that he does not see them ‚Ä¶ that they do not call\nattention to themselves, but simply \u0000avor and evaluate the images your\ncopy is forming in his mind.\nCertain classes of readers will notice these emotion de\u0000ners. When\nthey do, your copy becomes either questionable or corny to them, and\nyou have lost them. ÓÅ¢erefore, you have to know always whom you are\nwriting for. What their level of sophistication is‚Äîin tone as well as\nproduct-awareness. And you may have to change your tone when you\ntake the same ad from one class of media to another‚Äîdown as well as up.\n\nOf course, when everybody sees your emotion words, then you‚Äôve got\na bad ad, and you‚Äôd better rewrite, fast.\nAnd don‚Äôt forget the rhythms. Read the ad out loud. See how you can\nalmost scan it, as though it were close to blank verse. ÓÅ¢is richness of\nrhythm parallels the richness of image‚Äîhelps build the excitement and\nsensuousness of the mood.\nNow let‚Äôs look at another piece of pounding copy, and see how words\nand rhythms add to the power and momentum that are put behind its\nstaccato stream of claims:\n‚ÄúThis letter says that if you could only liberate the exact\nsame talent and intelligence and ability that you have tied\nup inside you today‚Äîthen you could:\n‚Äúread anything you wish, twice as fast as you can read it\ntoday‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚Äúabsorb facts like a sponge, and repeat them almost\nword for word years later ‚Ä¶\n‚Äúflash through math, business, financial problems that\nhave you stopped cold today‚Ä¶\n‚Äúhold people spellbound with the power of your speech\nand your written word ‚Ä¶\n‚Äúout-think others when you have to, tower over them in\njudgement, outshine them completely in imagination ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nHere again, there are two types of emotion-de\u0000ners. ÓÅ¢e power words\n(liberate ‚Ä¶ hold spellbound ‚Ä¶ out-think ‚Ä¶ tower over ‚Ä¶ outshine\ncompletely), which build a subconscious current of potency that\npermeates each individual claim as it occurs in the copy. And the\nfrankness, man-to-man, lets-let-our-hair-down tone-builders (this letter\nsays ‚Ä¶ tied up inside you ‚Ä¶ like a sponge ‚Ä¶ stopped cold) that say\nsilently that there‚Äôs no nonsense here, no high-faluting phrases‚Äîjust\ncommon-sense which can be absorbed by anyone.\nAnd, of course, the machine-gun rhythm. Short, choppy sentences.\nVerb ‚Ä¶ verb ‚Ä¶ verb. Claim ‚Ä¶ claim ‚Ä¶ claim. Propelling the reader\nthrough the copy. Piling promise upon promise, image upon image in an\nattempt to overwhelm him.\nNotice especially the vast difference between these two highly-\nsuccessful pieces of copy. ÓÅ¢eir vocabulary, the type of emotions they\nstrive to arouse, the images they use, the models of speech they borrow,\n\nthe length of sentence and paragraph, the ratio of adjectives to nouns and\nverbs, etc.\nWe could go on, of course. Go back to the Volkswagen copy, and see\nhow the emotional tone of sincerity is conveyed by the absence of\nadjectives, in all the places you‚Äôd ordinarily expect to \u0000nd them. As well as\nwhimsy, a continuous self-kidding, which builds, \u0000rst, a sort of corporate\naffection, and then trust.\nTry the \u0000re injector ad again. Notice how the long, rather clumsy\nsentences give a feeling of ingenuousness and reason to the copy Try to\nread them out loud. You can‚Äôt. ÓÅ¢ey don‚Äôt scan; they have no de\u0000nable\nrhythm: they don‚Äôt look like a ‚Äúcopy writer‚Äù wrote them at all. And, of\ncourse, there is the same straight-from-the-shoulder phraseology, to\nreinforce this feeling of honest appraisal.\nAll this, I repeat, is done unconsciously. You do not see it unless you\nlook for it. And sometimes you have to dig very deep indeed to get every\npiece of it.\nMood-building is deliberate on the part of the copywriter‚Äîunnoticed\non the part of his reader. As with so much of the rest of the ad, it lies\nunderneath the surface, to do its work imperceptibly.\n\nEPILOGUE: A COPY WRITER‚ÄôS LIBRARY\nI have now given you what I‚Äôve learned about writing copy. It has\ntaken many years to learn it‚Äîthree more to set it down to my own\nsatisfaction. I hope it will help you in the only way that really counts: to\ndo a better job and make a little more money.\nÓÅ¢ere are, of course, many many men in this industry who know far\nmore about these techniques, and who can produce far better copy than I.\nMy excuse for writing this book is that they don‚Äôt seem to have included\n‚Äîat least to my present knowledge‚Äîmany of the speci\u0000c techniques\nwhich I‚Äôve discussed with you here.\nSome of them have written books on the subject‚Äîgreat books‚Äîand\nI‚Äôd like to list them here for you. I think you should buy and read, every\none of them, and then thumb through them again every year or so, just to\ncatch what you may have forgotten.\nHere they are:\nIndispensable, of course, is Julian Watkins‚Äô great anthology: ÓÇªe 100\nGreatest Advertisements, Moore Publishing, 1949.\nClaude Hopkins wrote a great book, My Life in Advertising, Harper,\n1927. Make them dig it up for you. And see if you can‚Äôt get some of the\nold Hopkins ads.\nJohn E. Kennedy (not F.) wrote a little pamphlet many years ago\ncalled Intensive Advertising, which has just been republished by Printer‚Äôs\nInk. Get it. It‚Äôll be the most pro\u0000table evening‚Äôs reading you‚Äôve ever done.\nJ. K. Lasker, who worked with both these great writers, never wrote\nanything himself. But he did give a series of talks before his staff one\nweek, and Printers Ink has again captured them. ÓÅ¢ey‚Äôre called ÓÇªe Lasker\nStory.\nRobert Collier‚Äôs Letter Book is published by Prentice-Hall. It‚Äôs a gold\nmine.\nDavid Ogilvy wrote Confessions of an Advertising Man, which you can\nbuy as a paperback. Charming and wonderfully pro\u0000table.\n\nRosser Reeves‚Äô very short book, Reality in Advertising, is published by\nKnopf, and must be read several times before you get everything out of it\nyou should.\nMilton Biow‚Äôs book, Butting In, is marvelous in the \u0000rst half,\nrepetitive in the second.\nAnd don‚Äôt forget Campbell‚Äôs book, Writing Non-Fiction. Or those by\nCaples, Young, Glim and Bedell. Or the motivation research books by\nDichter and Martineau. Or the great book on layout, Visual Persuasion,\nby Baker.\nÓÅ¢en there are the books on American society today‚Äîby Mills,\nRiesman, Fromm, Kardiner and all the rest. And the articles on the\nemerging trends in the media. And the media themselves. And of course\n‚Äîyour primary source‚Äîthe ads themselves. Keep reading. Keep\nanalyzing. Keep writing. Keep looking for the new idea‚Äîthe million\ndollars hidden somewhere in that typewriter of yours. Always shoot for\nthe moon‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the few real thrills leÓÇù today!",

Actually, it would be\nimpossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually\ncreate this mass desire. He can only exploit it. And he dies when he tries\nto run against it.\n is has been shown time and time again in the automotive eld, for\nexample.
